</div>

<p>It was the week after Commencement.
The corridors, class-rooms, and
study hall of Saint Andrew&#8217;s stretched
in dim, silent vistas; over the tennis
court and the playground there brooded
a dead calm; the field, scene of so
many strenuous struggles, lay bare
and still in the summer sunlight; the
quadrangle, that so lately had rung to
parting cheer and &#8220;yell,&#8221; might have
been a cloister for midnight ghosts to
walk. The only sign or sound of life
came from the open archways of the
Gym, where the &#8220;left overs&#8221; (as the
boys who for various reasons had
been obliged to summer at Saint Andrew&#8217;s)
were working off the steam
condensed, as Jim Norris declared, to
the &#8220;busting&#8221; point by the last seven
days.</p>
<p>A city-bound college has its limitations,
and vacation at Saint Andrew&#8217;s
promised to be a very dull affair indeed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
The &#8220;left overs&#8221; had tried
everything to kill time. At present
their efforts seemed bent on killing
themselves; for Jim Norris and Dud
Fielding, sturdy fellows of fourteen,
were doing stunts on the flying trapeze
worthy of professional acrobats;
while Dan Dolan, swinging from a
high bar, was urging little Fred
Neville to a precarious poise on his
shoulder.</p>
<p>Freddy was what may be called a
perennial &#8220;left over.&#8221; He had been
the &#8220;kid&#8221; of Saint Andrew&#8217;s since he
was five years old, when his widowed
father had left him in a priestly
uncle&#8217;s care, and had disappeared no
one knew how or where. And as
Uncle Tom&#8217;s chosen path lay along
hard, lofty ways that small boys could
not follow, Fred had been placed by
special privilege in Saint Andrew&#8217;s to
grow up into a happy boyhood, the
pet and plaything of the house. He
was eleven now, with the fair face
and golden hair of his dead girl-mother,
and brown eyes that had a
boyish sparkle all their own.</p>
<p>They looked up dubiously at Dan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
now,&mdash;&#8220;daring Dan,&#8221; who for the last
year had been Freddy&#8217;s especial chum;
and to be long-legged, sandy-haired,
freckle-nosed Dan&#8217;s chum was an
honor indeed for a small boy of eleven.
Dan wore frayed collars and jackets
much too small for him; his shoes
were stubby-toed and often patched;
he made pocket money in various
ways, by &#8220;fagging&#8221; and odd jobbing
for the big boys of the college. But
he led the classes and games of the
Prep with equal success; and even
now the Latin class medal was swinging
from the breast of his shabby
jacket.</p>
<p>Dan had been a newsboy in very early
youth; but, after a stormy and often
broken passage through the parochial
school, he had won a scholarship at
Saint Andrew&#8217;s over all competitors.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; ye&#8217;ll be the fool to take it,&#8221;
Aunt Winnie had said when he
brought the news home to the little
attic rooms where she did tailor&#8217;s
finishing, and took care of Dan as well
as a crippled old grandaunt could.
&#8220;With all them fine gentlemen&#8217;s sons
looking down on ye for a beggar!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let them look,&#8221; Dan had said
philosophically. &#8220;Looks don&#8217;t hurt,
Aunt Win. It&#8217;s my chance and I&#8217;m
going to take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he was taking it bravely when
poor Aunt Win&#8217;s rheumatic knees
broke down utterly, and she had to go
to the &#8220;Little Sisters,&#8221; leaving Dan to
summer with the other &#8220;left overs&#8221; at
Saint Andrew&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Swing up,&#8221; he repeated, stretching
a sturdy hand to Fred. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be a
sissy. One foot on each of my shoulders,
and catch on to the bar above
my head. That will steady you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freddy hesitated. It was rather a
lofty height for one of his size.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t hold me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m
too heavy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too heavy!&#8221; repeated Dan, laughing
down on the slender, dapper little
figure at his feet. &#8220;Gee whilikins, I
wouldn&#8217;t even <i>feel</i> you!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was too much for any eleven-year-old
to stand. Freddy was not
very well. Brother Timothy had been
dosing him for a week or more, and
these long hot summer days made his
legs feel queer and his head dizzy. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
was rather hard sometimes to keep up
with Dan, who was making the most
of his holiday, as he did of everything
that came in his way. Freddy was
following him loyally, in spite of the
creeps and chills that betrayed malaria.
But now his brown eyes flashed
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a big brag, Dan Dolan!&#8221; he
said, stung by such a taunt at his size
and weight. &#8220;Just you try me!&#8221;</p>
<p>And catching Dan&#8217;s hand he made
a spring to his waist and a reckless
scramble to his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; said Dan, cheerily.
&#8220;Steady now, and hold on to the bar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel me now?&#8221; said Fred,
pressing down with all his small weight
on the sturdy figure beneath him.</p>
<p>&#8220;A mite!&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Sort of
like a mosquito had lit on me up there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you feel me now?&#8221; said Fred,
bringing his heels down with a dig.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out now!&#8221; cried Dan, sharply.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try dancing a jig up there.
Hold to the bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the warning came too late. The
last move was too much for the half-sick
boy. Freddy&#8217;s head began to turn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
his legs gave way&mdash;he reeled down to
the floor, and, white and senseless, lay
at Dan&#8217;s feet.</p>
<p>In the big, book-lined study beyond
the quadrangle, Father Regan was
settling final accounts prior to the
series of &#8220;retreats&#8221; he had promised
for the summer; while Brother Bart,
ruddy and wrinkled as a winter apple,
&#8220;straightened up,&#8221;&mdash;gathering waste
paper and pamphlets as his superior
cast them aside, dusting book-shelves
and mantel, casting the while many
an anxious, watchful glance through
the open window. The boys were
altogether too quiet this morning.
Brother Bart distrusted boyish quiet.
For the &#8220;Laddie,&#8221; as he had called
Freddy since the tiny boy had been
placed six years ago in his special
care, was the idol of the good man&#8217;s
heart. He had washed and dressed
and tended him in those early years
with almost a woman&#8217;s tenderness, and
was watching with jealous anxiety as
Laddie turned from childish ways into
paths beyond his care. Dan Dolan
was Brother Bart&#8217;s especial fear&mdash;Dan
Dolan, who belonged to the rough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
outside world from which Laddie had
been shielded; Dan Dolan, who, despite
tickets and medals, Brother Bart
felt was no mate for a little gentleman
like his boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re quarely still this morning,&#8221;
he said at last, giving voice to his fear.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking they are at no good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Father Regan, looking
up from the letter he was reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;The boys,&#8221; answered Brother Bart,&mdash;&#8220;the
four of them that was left over
with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four of them?&#8221; repeated the
Father, who, with the closing of the
schools, had felt the burden of his
responsibilities drop. &#8220;True, true! I
quite forgot we have four boys with
us. It must be dull for the poor
fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dull!&#8221; echoed Brother Bart,
grimly,&mdash;&#8220;dull is it, yer reverence?
It&#8217;s in some divilment they are from
morning until night. There&#8217;s no rule
for vacation days, as Mr. Linton says;
and so the four of them are running
wild as red Indians, up in the bell
tower, and in the ice pond that&#8217;s six
feet deep with black water, and scampering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
over the highest ledge of the
dormitory roof, till my heart nearly
leaps from my mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor fellows!&#8221; said Father Regan,
indulgently. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard on them, of
course. Let me see! Colonel Fielding
and his wife are in the Philippines,
I remember, and asked to leave Dudley
with us; and Judge Norris
couldn&#8217;t take Will with him to Japan;
and there&#8217;s our own little Fred of
course,&mdash;we always have him; and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That dare-devil of a Dan Dolan,
that&#8217;s the worst of all!&#8221; burst forth
Brother Bart. &#8220;It&#8217;s for me sins he
was left here, I know; with the Laddie
following everywhere he leads, like
he was bewitched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Danny! Aren&#8217;t you a little
hard on him, Brother Bart?&#8221; was the
smiling question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I am, I am,&mdash;God forgive me
for that same!&#8221; answered Brother
Bart, penitently. &#8220;But I&#8217;m no saint
like the rest of ye; and Laddie crept
into my heart six years ago, and I
can&#8217;t put him out. Wild Dan Dolan
is no fit mate for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Father Regan,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
gravely, though there was a quizzical
gleam in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, because&mdash;because&mdash;&#8221; hesitated
Brother Bart, rather staggered
by the question. &#8220;Sure ye know yerself,
Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; was the calm reply.
&#8220;Dan may be wild and mischievous&mdash;a
little rough perhaps, poor boy!&mdash;but
he will do Freddy no harm. He is a
bright, honest, manly fellow, making a
brave fight against odds that are hard
to face; and we must give him his
chance, Brother Bart. I promised his
good old aunt, who was broken-hearted
at leaving him, that I would
do all I could for her friendless, homeless
boy. As for mischief&mdash;well, I
rather like a spice of mischief at his
age. It is a sign of good health, body
and soul. But we must try to give
it a safer outlet than roofs and bell
towers,&#8221; he added thoughtfully. &#8220;Let
me see! If we could send our
&#8216;left overs&#8217; some place where they
could have more freedom. Why&mdash;why,
now that I think of it&#8221; (the
speaker&#8217;s grave face brightened as he
took up the letter he had been reading),
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
&#8220;maybe there&#8217;s a chance for
them right here. Father Tom Rayburn
has just written me that Freddy
has fallen heir to some queer old place
on the New England coast. It belonged
to his mother&#8217;s great-uncle,
an old whaling captain, who lived
there after an eccentric fashion of his
own. It seems that this ship was
stranded on this island more than fifty
years ago, and he fixed up the wreck,
and lived there until his death this
past month. The place has no value,
Father Tom thinks; but he spent two
of the jolliest summers of his own boyhood
with an old Captain Kane at
Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killykinick?&#8221; echoed Brother Bart.
&#8220;That sounds Irish, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does,&#8221; laughed Father Regan.
&#8220;Perhaps the old captain was an Irishman.
At any rate, there he lived,
showing a light every night at his
masthead to warn other ships off,&mdash;which
was quite unnecessary of
course, as the government attends to
all such matters now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be a queer sort of a place,&#8221;
said Brother Bart, doubtfully. &#8220;But it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
might do Laddie good to get a whiff of
the salt air and a swim in the sea.
He isn&#8217;t well, Brother Timothy says,
and as everyone can see. He has a
touch of the fever every day; and as
for weight, Dan Dolan would make
two of him. And his mother died
before she was five and twenty. God&#8217;s
holy will be done!&#8221; Brother Bart&#8217;s
voice broke at the words. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
thinking Laddie isn&#8217;t long for this
world, Father. There&#8217;s an angel-look
in his face that I don&#8217;t like to see.&#8221;
And the old Brother shook his head
lugubriously.</p>
<p>Father Regan laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t worry about that!
I&#8217;ve seen plenty of just such angels,
Brother Bart, and they grew up into
very hardy, mortal men, who had to
scuffle their way through life like the
rest of us. But Freddy is looking a
little peaked of late, as I noticed on
Commencement Day. I think that, as
you say, a breath of salt air would be
good for him. We might send all four
off together to this place of his.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it Dan Dolan with the rest?&#8221;
asked Brother Bart, in dismay.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course! We couldn&#8217;t keep
poor Dan here all alone,&#8221; was the
answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll have Laddie climbing the
rocks and swimming the seas like&mdash;like
a wild Indian,&#8221; said the good
man, despairingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! That angel boy of yours,
Brother Bart?&#8221; laughed the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye!&#8221; answered the good
Brother. &#8220;I&#8217;m not denying that Laddie
has a wild streak in him. It came
from his poor young father, I suppose.
Arrah! has there never been word or
sign from him, Father?&#8221; queried
Brother Bart, sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; was the grave reply,&mdash;&#8220;not
since he disappeared so strangely six
years ago. I presume he is dead.
He had been rather a wild young fellow;
but after his wife&#8217;s death he
changed completely, reproached himself
for having, as he said, broken
her heart, and got some morbid notion
of not being a fit father for his child.
He had lost his faith and was altogether
unbalanced, poor man! Luckily,
Freddy inherits a fortune from
his mother, and is well provided for;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
and now comes this other heritage
from the old great-uncle&mdash;Killykinick.
I really think&mdash;O God bless me! What
is the matter?&#8221; asked the speaker, turning
with a start, as, reckless of rules
and reverence, two white-faced boys
burst unannounced into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s Freddy Neville,
Father!&#8221; panted Jim Norris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Laddie,&mdash;my Laddie! What&#8217;s come
to him?&#8221; cried Brother Bart.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s tumbled off the high bar,&#8221;
gasped Dud Fielding, &#8220;and he is lying
all white and still, and&mdash;and dead,
Father!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>II.&mdash;Old Top.</p>
</div>

<p>There was a hurried rush to the scene
of accident; but first aid to the injured
had already been rendered.
Freddy lay on the Gym floor, pillowed
on Dan&#8217;s jacket, and reviving under
the ministration of a sturdy hand and
a very wet and grimy pocket-handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you go tumbling off
like that for?&#8221; asked Dan indignantly
as the &#8220;angel eyes&#8221; of his patient
opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; murmured Freddy,
faintly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you to stand steady, and you
didn&#8217;t,&mdash;you jumped!&#8221; said Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;So&mdash;so you&#8217;d feel me,&#8221; answered
Fred, memory returning as the darkness
began to brighten, and Brother
Bart and Brother Timothy and several
other anxious faces started out of the
breaking clouds. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not hurt,&mdash;I&#8217;m
not hurt a bit, Brother Bart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Blessed be God for that same!&#8221;
cried the good Brother, brokenly, as,
after close examination, Brother Timothy
agreed to this opinion. &#8220;And it
wasn&#8217;t the fault of the rapscallions
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
wid ye that ye&#8217;re not killed outright.
To be swinging like monkeys from a
perch, and ye half sick and lightheaded!
Put him in the bed, Brother
Timothy; and keep him there till we
see what comes of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Freddy was put to bed in the
dim quiet of the infirmary, to watch
developments. Brother Timothy gave
him an old fashioned &#8220;drought,&#8221; and he
went to sleep most comfortably. He
woke up feeling very well indeed, to enjoy
an appetizing repast of chicken
broth and custard. But when this went
on for two days, Freddy began to grow
restless.</p>
<p>Infirmary life was very well in
school time; indeed, when there were
other patients not too sick to share its
luxuries, it proved rather a pleasant
break in the routine of class-room and
study-hall. In fact, a late epidemic of
measles that filled every bed had
been a &#8220;lark&#8221; beyond Brother Timothy&#8217;s
suppression. But the infirmary
in vacation, with no chance for the
pillow fights that had made the
&#8220;measles&#8221; so hilarious, with no boy in
the next bed to exchange confidences
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
and reminiscences, with no cheery
shouts from the playground and
quadrangle, with only the long stretch
of bare, spotless rooms, white cots,
and Brother Timothy rolling pills in
the &#8220;doctor shop,&#8221; the infirmary was
dull and dreary indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I get up to-day, Brother?&#8221;
asked Freddy on the third morning,
as Brother Timothy took away a
breakfast tray cleared to the last
crumb of toast.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the Brother, who
from long dealing with small boys had
acquired the stony calm of a desert
sphinx. Beneath it he was a gentle,
patient, wise old saint, who watched
and prayed over his patients in a
way they little guessed. &#8220;No, you
can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Freddy, with a rebellious
kick at the counterpane. &#8220;The
bump on my head is gone and I&#8217;m
not sick at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not so sure of that,&#8221; answered
Brother Tim. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had
temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s &#8216;temperature&#8217;?&#8221; asked
Freddy, roused with interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what it is, but you&#8217;ll
have to stay here till it goes,&#8221; answered
Brother Tim, with decision.</p>
<p>And Freddy could only lay back on
his pillows in hopeless gloom, watching
the shadows of the big elm by his
window flickering over curtain and
coverlet. The great elm&mdash;or &#8220;Old
Top,&#8221; as it had been affectionately
called by generations of students&mdash;was
the pride of the college
grounds. Many a newcomer felt his
heart warm to his strange surroundings
when he found the name of father
or grandfather cut into the rough
bark, where men who had made later
marks on history&#8217;s page had left
youthful sign manual. More than
once the growth of the college buildings
had threatened to encroach upon
Old Top; but the big elm held its
prior claim, and new dormitory or
infirmary was set back that it might
rule with kingly right in its historic
place.</p>
<p>Many were the stories and legends
of which Old Top was the hero. In
the &#8220;great fire&#8221; its boughs had proven
a ladder of safety before modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
&#8220;escapes&#8221; were known. Civil-War
veterans told of hunted scouts hiding,
all unknown to the Fathers, in its
spreading branches; while the students&#8217;
larks and frolics to which it
had lent indulgent ear were ancient
history at many a grandfather&#8217;s fireside.</p>
<p>But, like all things earthly, the big
tree was growing old; a barbed wire
fencing surrounded the aging trunk,
and effectively prohibited climbing the
rotten and unsafe branches. Even
cutting names was forbidden. Freddy
had been the last allowed, as the &#8220;kid&#8221;
of the house, to put his initials beneath
his father&#8217;s. It had been quite an
occasion, his eleventh birthday. There
had been a party (Freddy always had
ten dollars to give a party on his
birthday); and then, surrounded by
his guests, still gratefully appreciative
of unlimited ice cream and strawberries,
he had carefully cut &#8220;F. W.
N. 19&mdash;&#8221; beneath the same signature
of twenty years ago. It was then too
twenty years ago. It was then too
hilarious an occasion for sad reflection;
but lying alone in the infirmary
to-day, Freddy&#8217;s memories took
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
doleful form as he recalled the &#8220;F.
W. N.&#8221; above his own, and began
to think of his father who had vanished
so utterly from his young life.</p>
<p>He had only the vaguest recollection
of a tall, handsome &#8220;daddy&#8221; who
had tossed him up in his arms and
frolicked and laughed with him in a
very dim, early youth. He could recall
more clearly the stern, silent man
of later years, of whom the five-year-boy
had been a little afraid. And he
retained a vivid memory of one bewildering
evening in the dusky parlor
of Saint Andrew&#8217;s when a shaking,
low voiced father had held him tight
to his breast for one startling moment,
and then whispered hoarsely in his
ear, &#8220;Good-bye, my little son,&mdash;good-bye
for ever!&#8221; It was very sad, as
Freddy realized to-day (he had never
considered the matter seriously before),&mdash;very
sad to have a father bid
you good-bye forever. And to have
your mother dead, too,&mdash;such a lovely
mother! Freddy had, in his small
trunk, a picture of her that was as
pretty as any of the angels on the
chapel windows. And now he had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
&#8220;temperature,&#8221; and maybe he was going
to die, too, like some of those very
good little boys of whom Father
Martin read aloud on Sundays.</p>
<p>Freddy&#8217;s spirits were sinking into a
sunless gloom, when suddenly there
came a whistle through the open window,&mdash;a
whistle that made him start
up breathless on his pillow. For only
one boy in Saint Andrew&#8217;s could
achieve that clear high note. It was
Dan Dolan calling,&mdash;but how, where?
Freddy&#8217;s window was four stories
high, without porch or fire escape
and that whistle was almost in his ear.
He pursed up his trembling lips and
whistled back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hi!&#8221; came a cautious voice, and
the leafy shadows of Old Top waved
violently. &#8220;You&#8217;re there, are you?
Brother Tim around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Freddy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll swing in for a minute.&#8221;
And, with another shake of Old Top,
Dan bestrode the window ledge,&mdash;a
most cheery-looking Dan, grinning
broadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&mdash;how did you get up?&#8221; asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
Freddy, thinking of the barbed wire
defences below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead easy,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Just
swung across from the organ-loft windows.
They wouldn&#8217;t let me come up
and see you. Brother Bart, the old
softy, said I&#8217;d excite you. What&#8217;s the
matter, anyhow? Is it the tumble&mdash;or
typhoid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither,&#8221; said Fred. &#8220;I feel fine,
but Brother Tim says I&#8217;ve got temperature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; replied Freddy.
&#8220;You better not come too near, or you
may catch it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, no!&#8221; said Dan, who was
poised easily on his lofty perch. &#8220;I
never catch anything. But I&#8217;ll keep
ready for a jump, or Brother Tim will
catch me, and there will be trouble
for sure. And as for Brother Bart, I
don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;d do if he thought
I had come near you. Jing! but he
gave it to me hot and heavy about
letting you get that tumble! He
needn&#8217;t. I felt bad enough about it
already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you, Dan?&#8221; asked Fred,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
quite overcome by such an admission.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rotten!&#8221; was the emphatic answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t eat any dinner, though
we had cherry dumpling. And Brother
Bart rubbed it in, saying I had killed
you. Then I got the grumps, and
when Dud Fielding gave me some of
his sass we had a knock-out fight that
brought Father Rector down on us
good and strong. I tell you it&#8217;s been
tough lines all around. And this is
what you call&mdash;vacation!&#8221; concluded
Dan, sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221; said Freddy. &#8220;The
tumble didn&#8217;t hurt me much. I guess
I was sort of sick anyhow. And to
fight Dud Fielding!&#8221; The speaker&#8217;s
eyes sparkled. &#8220;Oh, I bet you laid
him out, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I, though! Shut up one eye,
and made that Grecian nose of his
look like a turnip. It ain&#8217;t down yet,&#8221;
answered Dan, with satisfaction. &#8220;He
fired me up talking about Aunt Win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did he?&#8221; asked Freddy, sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes: said I ought to be ditch-digging
to keep her out of the poorhouse,
instead of pushing in with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
respectable boys here. Sometimes I
think that myself,&#8221; added Dan in
another tone. &#8220;But it wasn&#8217;t any of
that blamed plute&#8217;s business to knock
it into me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t true: your aunt isn&#8217;t in
the poorhouse, Dan?&#8221; said Freddy,
eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no, not exactly,&#8221; answered
Dan. &#8220;But she is with the Little Sisters,
which is next thing to it. And I
ain&#8217;t like the rest of you, I know; and
don&#8217;t need Dud Fielding to tell me.
But just let me get a good start and
I&#8217;ll show folks what Dan Dolan can
do. I&#8217;ll be ready for something better
than a newsboy or a bootblack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, you&#8217;ll never be anything
like that!&#8221; said Freddy, in dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been,&#8221; was the frank reply.
&#8220;Given many a good shine for a
nickel. Could sell more papers than
any little chap on the street. Was out
before day on winter mornings to get
them hot from the press, when I
hadn&#8217;t turned seven years old. But I
ain&#8217;t going back to it,&mdash;no, sir!&#8221; Dan&#8217;s
lips set themselves firmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m on the
climb. Maybe I won&#8217;t get very far,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
but I&#8217;ve got my foot on the ladder.
I&#8217;m going to hold my own against Dud
Fielding and all his kind, no matter
how they push; and I told Father
Rector that yesterday when they were
plastering up Dud&#8217;s eye and nose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, you didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. I was just boiling up,
and had to bust out, I guess. And
when he lectured us about being gentlemen,
I told him I didn&#8217;t aim at
anything like that. I wasn&#8217;t made for
it, as I knew; but I was made to be a
man, and I was going to hold up like
one, and stand no shoving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan!&#8221; gasped Freddy, breathlessly.
&#8220;And&mdash;and what did he say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; answered Dan, grimly.
&#8220;But from the looks of things, I rather
guess I&#8217;m in for a ticket of leave.
That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m up here. Couldn&#8217;t go
off without seeing you,&mdash;telling you
how sorry I was I let you get that
fall off my shoulders. I oughtn&#8217;t to
have dared a kid like you to fool-tricks
like that. I was a big dumb-head,
and I&#8217;d like to kick myself for
it. For I think more of you than any
other boy in the college, little or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
big,&mdash;I surely do. And I&#8217;ve brought
you something, so when I&#8217;m gone you
won&#8217;t forget me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan dived into his pocket and
brought out a round disk of copper
about the size of a half dollar. It was
rimmed with some foreign crest, and
name and date.</p>
<p>&#8220;An old sailor man gave it to me,&#8221;
said Dan, as he reached over to
Freddy&#8217;s bed and handed him the
treasure. &#8220;He was a one-legged old
chap that used to sit down on the
wharf sort of dazed and batty, until
the boys roused him by pelting and
hooting at him; and then he&#8217;d fire
back curse words at them that would
raise your hair. It was mean of them,
for he was old and lame and sick; and
one day I just lit out a couple of
measly little chaps and ducked them
overboard for their sass. After that
we were sort of friends, me and old
&#8216;Nutty,&#8217; as everyone called him. I&#8217;d
buy tobacco and beer for him, and
give him an old paper now and then;
and when he got down and out for
good Aunt Win made me go for the
priest for him and see him through.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
He gave me this at the last. He had
worn it on a string around his neck,
and seemed to think it was something
grand. It&#8217;s a medal for bravery that
the poor old chap had won more than
forty years ago. Ben Wharton offered
me a dollar for it to put in his museum,
but I wouldn&#8217;t sell it. It seemed
sort of mean to sell poor old Nutty&#8217;s
medal. But I&#8217;d like to give it to you,
so you&#8217;ll remember me when I&#8217;ve
gone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but you&#8217;re not&mdash;not going
away, Dan!&#8221; said Freddy. &#8220;And I
can&#8217;t take your medal, anyhow. I&#8217;d
remember you without it. You&#8217;re the
best chum I ever had,&mdash;the very best.
And&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker broke off, stammering;
for a second visitor had suddenly appeared
at his bedside: Father Regan
who had entered the infirmary unheard
and unseen, and who now stood
with his eyes fixed in grave displeasure
on the daring Dan.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>III.&mdash;A Judgment.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan!&#8221; said Father Regan, as
the reckless interloper flushed and
paled beneath his steady gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan!&#8221; echoed Brother Tim,
who had come in behind his honored
visitor. &#8220;How ever did he get past
me! I&#8217;ve been saying my beads at the
door without this half hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Swung in by Old Top,&#8221; ventured
Dan, feeling concealment was vain.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dared Old Top at this height,
when scarcely a bough is sound! You
must be mad, boy. It is God&#8217;s mercy
that you did not break your neck.
Don&#8217;t you know the tree is unsafe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; answered Dan.
&#8220;But&mdash;but I had to see Freddy again,
and they wouldn&#8217;t let me come up. I
just <i>had</i> to see him, if it killed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was a sudden break in
the young voice that startled his
hearer. But a glance at the dizzy and
forbidden height of Old Top and
Father Regan was stern again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you have to see him, if it
killed you?&#8221; he asked briefly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Because I wanted to tell how bad
I felt about letting him get hurt, because&mdash;because
he has been better to
me than any boy in the school, because&mdash;because&mdash;&#8221;
(again Dan&#8217;s tone
grew husky) &#8220;I just had to bid Freddy
good-bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Father, no, no!&#8221; Freddy burst
out tremulously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t let him say
good-bye! Don&#8217;t send Dan away,
Father, please! He won&#8217;t fight any
more, will you, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not promising that,&#8221; answered
Dan, sturdily. &#8220;I won&#8217;t stand shoving
and knocking, not even to keep my
place here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan!&#8221; cried Freddy, in dismay
at such an assertion. &#8220;Why, you said
you would work day and night to stay
at Saint Andrew&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Work, yes,&#8221; replied Dan, gruffly.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind work, but I won&#8217;t ever
play lickspittle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is that the way ye&#8217;d be talking
before his reverence?&#8221; broke in
Brother Tim, indignantly. &#8220;Get out
of the infirmary this minute, Dan
Dolan; for it&#8217;s the devil&#8217;s own pride
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
that is on yer lips and in yer heart,
God forgive me for saying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle this later,&#8221; said Father
Regan, quietly. &#8220;Go down to my
study, Dan, and wait for me. I have
a message for Freddy from his uncle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, Dan!&#8221; (There was a sob
in the younger boy&#8217;s voice as he felt
all this parting might mean.) &#8220;I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll
miss you dreadfully, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Dan, gripping his
little comrade&#8217;s hand. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t worth
missing. I&#8217;m glad I came, anyhow, to
say good-bye and good-luck, Freddy!&#8221;
And he turned away at the words,
with something shining in his blue
eyes that Father Regan knew was not
all defiance.</p>
<p>It was a long wait in the study. Dan
had plenty of time to think, and his
thoughts were not very cheerful. He
felt he had lost his chance,&mdash;the
chance that had been to him like the
sudden opening of a gate in the grim
stone wall of circumstances that had
surrounded him,&mdash;a gate beyond
which stretched free, sunlit paths to
heights of which he had never dreamed.
He had lost his chance; for a free
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
scholarship at Saint Andrew&#8217;s depended
on good conduct and observance of
rules as well as study; and Dan felt he
had doubly and trebly forfeited his
claim. But he would not whine. Perhaps
it was only the plucky spirit of
the street Arab that filled his breast,
perhaps something stronger and nobler
that steadied his lip and kindled
his eye, as he looked around the spacious,
book-lined room, and realized
all that he was losing&mdash;had lost. For
Dan loved his books,&mdash;the hard-earned
scholarship proved it. Many a midnight
hour had found him, wrapped
in his worn blankets, studying by the
light of a flaring candle-end stuck
perilously on his bedpost, after good
Aunt Win had thriftily put out the
lamp, and believed Danny was sound
asleep preparatory to a start on his
beat at break of day.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the brightest, clearest,
quickest minds I ever knew,&#8221; Dan&#8217;s
teacher had told Father Regan when
awarding the scholarship,&mdash;&#8220;if he can
only keep the track. But he has a
bold spirit, and it will be hard on him
among all those &#8216;high-steppers&#8217; of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
yours at Saint Andrew&#8217;s. He is likely
to bolt and break away.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dan had been too busy with
his books all the year to mind &#8220;high-steppers.&#8221;
His patched jacket kept
the head of the classes, and his
stubby-toed shoes marched up every
month to get the ticket, and he had
helped more than one heavy-witted
&#8220;high-stepper&#8221; through conditions
that threatened to put him out of the
race. Most of the Saint Andrew&#8217;s boys
were manly youngsters, with whom
jackets and shoes did not count against
brain and brawn; and strong, clever,
quick-witted Dan had held his place
in schoolroom and playground unquestioned.
But there were exceptions,
and Dud Fielding was one of
them. He had disliked the &#8220;poor
scholar&#8221; from the first. Dud was a
tall, handsome fellow, filled with ideas
of his own importance; and Dan had
downed him more than once in field
and class-room, to his great disgust.
Worst than all, in appreciation of his
careful costuming, Dan had alluded
to him as &#8220;Dudey,&#8221;&mdash;a boyish liberty
which, considering the speaker&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
patched jacket, Master Fielding
could not forgive. It was the repetition
of this remark, when Dud had appeared
garbed in a summer suit of
spotless linen, that had precipitated
yesterday&#8217;s fight.</p>
<p>Altogether, with all the restraints
and interests of school time removed,
vacation was proving a perilous period
to the &#8220;left-overs&#8221; at Saint Andrew&#8217;s.
Dan realized this as, turning his back
on the book-lined room, with his hands
thrust in his pockets, looking gloomily
out of the broad window that opened
on the quadrangle, he stood awaiting
&#8220;judgment.&#8221; He expected no mercy:
he felt grimly he had no claim to it.
Maybe if he had a rich father or uncle
or somebody grand and great to speak
up for him, he might be given another
chance; but a poor boy who, as Dud
Fielding said, ought to be &#8220;ditch digging&#8221;&mdash;Dan
choked up again at the
thought that, after all, perhaps Dud
was right: he was not the sort to be
pushing in here. He ought to be out
in his own rough world, working his
own rough way. All those fancies of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
his for better, higher things had been
only &#8220;pipe dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>But jing, it would be hard to give up!
Dan looked out at the quadrangle where
he had led so many a merry game; at
the ball field, scene of battle and victory
that even Dud Fielding could not dispute;
at the long stretch of the study
hall windows opposite; at the oriel of
the chapel beyond. All spoke to him of
a life that had been like air and sunshine
to a plant stretching its roots and
tendrils in the dark.</p>
<p>And he must leave it all! He must
go back again to the old ways, the old
work! He was big enough now to
drive a butcher&#8217;s wagon, or clean fish
and stuff sausages at Pete Patterson&#8217;s
market store; or&mdash;or&mdash;there were
other things he could do that a fellow
like him must do when he is &#8220;down and
out.&#8221; And while he still stared from
the window, the grim, dogged look
settling heavier upon his young face,
Dan caught a footstep behind him, and
turned to face Father Regan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve kept you waiting longer than I
expected, Dan, but I had great news
for Freddy,&mdash;news that took some time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
to tell.&#8221; The speaker sank into the tall
stiff-backed chair known to many a
young sinner as the &#8220;judgment seat.&#8221;
&#8220;Now&#8221; (the clear, keen eyes fixed
themselves gravely on the boy) &#8220;I want
to have a talk with you. Things can
not go on in this way any longer, even
in vacation time. I must say that, after
the last year&#8217;s good record, I am disappointed
in you, Dan,&mdash;sorely disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Father,&#8221; was the respectful
answer, but the grim, hard look on
the young face did not change. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
made a lot of trouble, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have,&#8221; was the grave answer,
&#8220;and trouble I did not expect from you.
Still, circumstances have been against
you, I must confess. But this does not
alter the fact that you have broken
strict rules that even in vacation we
can not relax,&mdash;broken them deliberately
and recklessly. You are evidently
impatient of the restraint here at Saint
Andrew&#8217;s; so I have concluded not to
keep you here any longer, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not asking it, Father.&#8221; Dan
tried bravely to steady voice and lip.
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to go whenever you say.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow, then,&#8221; continued Father
Regan,&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;ve made arrangements for
you to leave to-morrow at ten. Brother
Francis will see that your trunk is
packed to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; said Dan, somewhat
bewildered at the friendly tone in
which this sentence was delivered. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to see Mr. Raymond and Mr. Shipman
before I go, and thank them for
all they&#8217;ve done for me; and Father
Roach and Father Walsh and all of
them; and to say I&#8217;m sorry I made any
trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good gracious,&#8221; laughed Father
Regan, &#8220;one would think you were on
your dying bed, boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I feel like it,&#8221; blurted out Dan,
no longer able to choke down the lump
in his throat. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather die, a good
deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather die!&#8221; exclaimed Father
Regan,&mdash;&#8220;rather die than go to Killykinick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killykinick!&#8221; echoed Dan, breathlessly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not&mdash;not sending me
to a Reform, Father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reform!&#8221; repeated the priest.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I won&#8217;t go,&#8221; said Dan, desperately.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
&#8220;You haven&#8217;t any right to put
me there. I&#8217;m not wild and bad enough
for that. I&#8217;ll keep honest and respectable.
I&#8217;ll go to work. I can get a job
at Pete Patterson&#8217;s sausage shop to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Reform! Sausage shop! What are
you talking about, you foolish boy,
when I am only sending you all off for
a summer holiday at the seashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A summer holiday at the seashore!&#8221;
echoed Dan in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, at Freddy&#8217;s place&mdash;Killykinick.
I have just heard from his uncle, and he
thinks it would be a fine thing to send
Freddy up there to shake off his
malaria. There&#8217;s a queer old house
that his great-uncle left him, and an
old sailor who still lives there to look
out for things; and all the boating,
bathing, swimming, fishing a set of
lively young fellows can want; so I am
going to ship you all off there to-morrow
morning with Brother Bart. It&#8217;s
plain you can&#8217;t stand six weeks of vacation
here, especially when there will
be a general retreat for the Fathers
next month. You see, I simply have
to send you away.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;&#8221;
(Dan&#8217;s voice trembled, his eyes shone,)&mdash;&#8220;you
mean I can come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back, of course, when school
opens.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; said Dan, drawing a long
breath. &#8220;I&mdash;I thought you were putting
me out for good and all. I
thought, with the fight and the climb
and hurting Freddy I&mdash;I had done for
myself. I thought&mdash;&#8221; Here Dan&#8217;s feelings
became too much for him, and he
could only gulp down the sob that rose
in his throat, with a look that went to
Father Regan&#8217;s kind heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor boy, no, no! Put you out
of Saint Andrew&#8217;s for good and all! I
never thought of such a thing for a
moment. Of course I object seriously
to fighting, to your reckless venture to
Old Top; but&mdash;well, you had strong
temptations, and in vacation time one
must not be too severe. At Killykinick
there will be more elbow-room. Have
you ever been to the seashore?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never farther than the wharfs.
But I can swim and dive and float,&#8221;
answered Dan, wisely reserving the information
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
that, as a member of the
&#8220;Wharf Rats,&#8221; he had been ducked
overboard at the age of six, to sink or
swim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Father Regan. &#8220;Then
you&#8217;ll have a fine time. And I am depending
on you to look out for the other
boys. They have grown up in softer
ways, and are not used to roughing it,
as it is likely you will have to rough it
at Killykinick. But it will be good for
you all,&mdash;for you all,&#8221; repeated the
speaker cheerily, as he saw in Dan&#8217;s
brightening face the joyful relief the
boy did not know how to speak. &#8220;And
you will come back ready for double &#8216;X&#8217;
work in the fall. I am looking for great
things from you, Dan. You&#8217;ve made a
fine start, my boy! Keep it up, and
some day you will be signing all the
capital letters to Dan Dolan&#8217;s name
that Saint Andrew&#8217;s can bestow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I don&#8217;t know about that,
Father,&#8221; said Dan, his speech softening
into Aunt Winnie&#8217;s Irish tones with the
warming of his heart. &#8220;You&#8217;re very
good to me, but sometimes I think&mdash;well,
what I thrashed Dud Fielding for
telling me: that I&#8217;ve no right to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
pushing into a grand school like this.
I ought to keep my place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where is your place?&#8221; was the
calm question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, sure&mdash;&#8221; Dan hesitated as he
recalled a very checkered childhood.
&#8220;Now that Aunt Winnie is all broke up,
I can&#8217;t say, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I will tell you, my boy! Just
now, by the goodness and guidance of
God, it is here,&mdash;here, where you have
equal rights with any boy in the school.
You have won them in winning your
scholarship; they are yours as justly as
if you had a father paying a thousand
a year. There may be a little rough
rubbing now and then from fellows like
Dud Fielding; but&mdash;well, everything
that is worth having has its cost. So
stand to your colors! Be, as you said
yesterday, neither a bully nor a coward,
but a man. Now go to see Aunt Winnie
and bid her good-bye. Tell her I
am sending you off for the jolliest kind
of a holiday to Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know how to thank you,
Father!&#8221; stammered Dan, feeling that
his blackened sky had suddenly burst
into rainbow light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try,&#8221; was the kind answer.
&#8220;I understand, Dan. God bless you,
my boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, laying his hand for a moment
on Dan&#8217;s sandy thatch of hair, Father
Regan dismissed the case.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>IV.&mdash;Aunt Winnie.</p>
</div>

<p>It was a delighted Dan that bounded
down the broad staircase and took a
flying leap from the stone portico of the
great hall door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; said Jim Norris, who was
lazily stretched on the grass, reading.
&#8220;Is that a jump or a kick out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A jump,&#8221; answered Dan, grinning:
&#8220;though I was primed for the other,
sure. How is Dudey&#8217;s nose?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming down,&#8221; said Jim, who was
an easy-going mixer, whom everybody
liked. &#8220;About the size and shape of a
spring radish to-day. My, but he&#8217;s hot
against you, Dan! Look out for him!
Snake in the grass is nothing to Dud
Fielding on the boil. Won&#8217;t even rattle
fairly before he strikes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t take the glad hand if I
stretched it out to him and said I was
sorry?&#8221; asked Dan. &#8220;Just now I feel
like being at peace with everybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much!&#8221; said Jim, impressively.
&#8220;Or if he did there would be a snake
sting ready for you, all the same. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
know Dud Fielding. He&#8217;ll get even
with you if he dies for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; was the cheerful reply.
&#8220;Let him get even then. Have you
heard about Killykinick, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes: Father Regan told me. I
don&#8217;t know what or where it is, but I&#8217;m
ready for a start if it&#8217;s a cannibal isle.
Anything is better than dying of dullness
here. Where are you off so fast,
Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To see my aunt. She&mdash;she&mdash;&#8221;
There was a moment&#8217;s hesitation, for
Dan knew all the admission meant to
boys like Jim. But he added boldly:
&#8220;She is at the Little Sisters&#8217;, you know,
and I want to bid her good-bye before
I leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do. These old aunts
are great,&#8221; said Jim, with a friendly
nod. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got one myself up in the
country. Wears bonnets and gowns
that look as if they came out of the
Ark. But, golly, she can make doughnuts
and apple pies that beat the band!
I&#8217;d rather spend a week at Aunt
Selina&#8217;s than any place I know. Going
to walk or ride, Dan?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Walk,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I generally
do. It&#8217;s good for my health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on a day like this. I&#8217;ve got a
pocketful of car tickets,&#8221; said Jim,
shaking a dozen or so out on the grass.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll have no use for them at Killykinick.
Help yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dan, sturdily. &#8220;Thank
you all the same, Jim! But I don&#8217;t
mind walking a bit. I&#8217;ll match you at
a game of tennis when I get back, and
do you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; answered Jim, who,
though slow and lazy and a bit dull at
his books, was a gentleman through
and through. Three generations of
Norrises had cut their names on Old
Top.</p>
<p>And, lighter hearted for this friendliness,
Dan kept on his way by short cuts
and cross streets until he reached the
quiet suburb where the modest buildings
of the &#8220;Little Sisters&#8221; stretched
long and wide behind their grey stone
walls. He was admitted by a brisk,
kind little old woman, who was serving
as portress; and after some parley,
was shown up into Aunt Winnie&#8217;s
room. It was spotless in its cleanliness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
and bare save for the most necessary
articles of furniture. There were three
other old ladies about in various stages
of decrepitude, who seemed only dully
conscious of Dan&#8217;s appearance; but
Aunt Winnie, seated in her armchair by
the window, started up in tremulous
rapture at sight of her boy. Despite
her age and infirmity, she was still a
trig little body, with snow-white hair
waved about a kind old wrinkled face
and dim soft eyes, that filled with tears
at &#8220;Danny&#8217;s&#8221; boyish hug and kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long time ye&#8217;ve been coming,&#8221;
she said reproachfully. &#8220;I thought ye
were forgetting me entirely, Danny
lad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgetting you!&#8221; echoed Dan.
&#8220;Now, you know better than to talk
like that, Aunt Win. I&#8217;m thinking of
you day and night. I&#8217;ve got no one
else to think of but you, Aunt Win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisht now,&mdash;whisht!&#8221; Aunt Winnie
sank her voice to a whisper, and
nodded cautiously towards the nearest
old lady. &#8220;She do be listening, lad.
I&#8217;ve told them all of the grand, great
college ye&#8217;re at, and the fine, bright lad
ye are, but I&#8217;ve told them nothing more.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
Ye&#8217;re not to play the poor scholar
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see!&#8221; said Dan, grinning.
&#8220;Go on with your game then, Aunt
Win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking to be remembered,&#8221;
Aunt Winnie continued dolefully.
&#8220;What with all the French and Latin
ye have to study, and the ball playing
that you&#8217;re doing. I can&#8217;t look for you
to think of a poor lone lame woman like
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Win!&#8221; burst forth Dan, impetuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisht!&#8221; murmured Aunt Win
again, with a glance at the old lady
who was blinking sleepily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t ye
be giving yerself away. And I suppose
it&#8217;s the fine holiday that ye&#8217;re having
now wid the rest of yer mates,&#8221;
she went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dan, feeling he could
truthfully humor the old lady&#8217;s harmless
pride here. &#8220;We&#8217;re off to-morrow
for the jolliest sort of a time at the
seashore. Freddy Neville, the nicest
little chap in college, has a place up
somewhere on the New England coast,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and four of us are going there for the
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Danny launched into eager details
that made Aunt Winnie&#8217;s eyes
open indeed. But there was a little
quiver in her voice when she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that&#8217;s fine for you,&mdash;that&#8217;s fine
for you indeed, Danny! We can talk
plain now; for&#8221; (as a reassuring snore
came from her dozing neighbor)
&#8220;thank God, she&#8217;s off asleep! It&#8217;s the
grand thing for you to be going with
mates like that. It&#8217;s what I&#8217;m praying
for as I sit here sad and lonely, Dan,
that God will give ye His blessing, and
help ye up, up, up, high as mortal man
can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you with me, Aunt Win,&#8221; said
Dan, who, seated on the footstool of the
chair, was smoothing her wrinkled
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, my lad, I don&#8217;t ask that!
I&#8217;m not asking that at all, Danny. I&#8217;ll
not be houlding to ye, and dragging ye
down while ye&#8217;re climbing. And whisper,
lad, while there&#8217;s no one listening:
it&#8217;s naither wise nor best for ye to be
coming here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; asked Dan, for he knew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
that he was the light of poor Aunt
Win&#8217;s eyes and the joy of her old heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because,&#8221; faltered Aunt
Winnie, &#8220;though it&#8217;s fibs I&#8217;ve been telling
about yer grandeur and greatness&mdash;God
forgive me that same!&mdash;the old
busybodies around will be wondering
and prating about why ye lave me here,
Dan,&mdash;because I might be a shame to
ye before all the fine gentlemen&#8217;s sons
that have taken ye up,&mdash;because&#8221;
(Aunt Win&#8217;s voice broke entirely) &#8220;a
poor old woman like me will only hurt
and hinder ye, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt and hinder me!&#8221; echoed Dan,
who, with all his cleverness, could not
understand the depths and heights of
good old Aunt Winnie&#8217;s love.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, lad, hurt and hinder ye; for
ye&#8217;re on the way up, and I&#8217;ll not be the
one to hould ye back. I do be dreaming
grand dreams of ye, Danny lad,&mdash;dreams
that I don&#8217;t dare to spake out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisper them, then, Aunt Win,&#8221;
urged Dan, softly. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll make
them come true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye couldn&#8217;t,&#8221; said the old woman,
her dim eyes shining. &#8220;Only God in
heaven can do that. For I dream that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
I see you on His altar, the brightest
place that mortal man can reach. I&#8217;ll
ne&#8217;er live to see that dream come true,
Danny; but I believe it would make
my old heart leap if I was under the
sod itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Aunt Win, Aunt Win!&#8221; Dan lifted
the wrinkled hand to his lips. &#8220;That is
a great dream, sure enough. Sometimes,
Aunt Win, I&mdash;I dream it myself.
But, then, a rough-and-tumble fellow
like me, always getting into scrapes,
soon wakes up. But one thing is sure:
you can&#8217;t shake me, Aunt Win. Dreaming
or waking, I&#8217;ll stick to you forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, lad,&mdash;no!&#8221; said the old
woman, tremulously. &#8220;I&#8217;d not have ye
bother with me. Sure it&#8217;s the fine place
I have here, with my warm room and
nice bed, and the good Little Sisters to
care for me, and the chapel close to
hand. But I miss our own little place,
sure, sometimes, Danny dear! I miss
the pot of flowers on the window (it&#8217;s
against the rule to grow flowers here),
and me own little blue teapot on the
stove, and Tabby curled up on the mat
before the fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aunt Winnie broke down and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
sobbed outright, while Danny was
conscious of a lump in his throat that
held him dumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Tabby!&#8221; continued Aunt
Winnie. &#8220;I hope the Mulligans are
good to her, Dan. D&#8217;ye ever see her
as ye pass their gate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Molly Mulligan
has tied a blue ribbon around her
neck, and she is the pride of the
house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she has forgotten me, of
course!&#8221; sighed Aunt Winnie. &#8220;But
what could I expect of a cat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forgotten you? Not a bit! Molly
says she steals into your room upstairs
and cries for you every night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it was the sore parting for us
all, God help us!&#8221; said Aunt Winnie,
brokenly. &#8220;But as long as it brings
you luck, lad, I&#8217;ll never complain. This
is the holy place to die in, and
what could a poor sick ould woman
ask more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot&mdash;a lot more!&#8221; burst forth
Danny, passionately. &#8220;You should
have a place to live and be happy in,
Aunt Win. You should have your
own fire and your own teapot, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
your own cat in your own home; and
I mean to get it back for you just as
quick as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whisht! whisht!&#8221; said Aunt Win,
nervously, as the old lady nearby
roused up, startled from her nap.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time ye were going, Danny;
for ye&#8217;re a long way from college, and
I wouldn&#8217;t keep ye against rules. I
hope ye&#8217;ll have a fine time at the seashore,
with the fishing and boating
and all the other sports. Good-bye
and God bless ye, lad, until we meet
again! Good-bye, Danny dear!&#8221; And,
realizing from the wide-open eyes of
the old lady near him that all confidential
communications were over,
Dan kissed Aunt Win&#8217;s withered
cheek, and, his heart swelling with
feelings he could not speak, took his
way back to Saint Andrew&#8217;s, all his
dreams, hopes, ambitions for the future
strangely shaken.</p>
<p>Aunt Win,&mdash;gentle, loving, heartsick,
homesick Aunt Win! Aunt Win,
begging him to give her up lest she
should hurt and hinder him in his
opening way! Aunt Win sighing for
the little place she had called home,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
even while she was ready to give it up
forever and die silent and lonely, that
her boy might climb to heights of
which she could only dream and never
see! Dear, faithful, true-hearted,
self-forgetting Aunt Win! Dan felt his
own eyes blurring as he thought of all
she had done, of all she was ready to
sacrifice.</p>
<p>And&mdash;and&mdash;the other thought followed
swiftly: he could give it all back
to her,&mdash;the little attic rooms over
Mulligans&#8217;, the flowerpot in the window,
the blue teapot on the stove,
Tabby on the hearth-rug,&mdash;he could
give it all back to Aunt Win and bring
her home. It would be long, long years
before the higher paths into which he
had turned would yield even humble
living; but the old ways were open to
him still: the &#8220;ditch-digging&#8221; with
which Dud Fielding had taunted
him, the meat wagon, the sausage shop,
that he had been considering only a few
hours ago. What right had he to leave
the good old woman, who had mothered
him, lonely and heartsick that he might
climb beyond her reach? And yet&mdash;yet
to give up Saint Andrew&#8217;s, with all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
that it meant to him; to give up all
his hopes, his dreams; to turn his
back on those wide corridors and book-lined
rooms for counter and cleaver;
to give up,&mdash;to give up! Quite dizzy
with his contending thoughts, Dan was
striding on his way when a hearty voice
hailed him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! That you, Dan? Jump in
and I&#8217;ll give you a lift.&#8221; And Pete
Patterson&#8217;s ruddy face looked out from
the white-topped wagon at the curb. &#8220;I
was just thinking of you,&#8221; said Pete,
as Dan willingly sprang up to the seat
at his side; for Pete had been a
friendly creditor in the days of the little
attic home when credit was sometimes
sorely needed. &#8220;Are you in with the
&#8216;high brows&#8217; for good and all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; hesitated Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because if you&#8217;re not,&#8221; continued
Pete&mdash;&#8220;and what tarnation use a
sturdy chap like you will find in all
that Latin and Greek stuff, I can&#8217;t
see,&mdash;if you&#8217;re not in for it, I can give
you a chance.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>V.&mdash;A &#8220;Chance.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I can give you a chance,&#8221; repeated
Pete, as he turned to Dan with his
broad, ruddy face illuminated by a
friendly smile. &#8220;It&#8217;s a chance I
wouldn&#8217;t hold out to everybody, but I
know you for a wide-awake youngster,
as honest as you are slick. Them two
don&#8217;t go together in general; but it&#8217;s
the combination I&#8217;m looking fur just
now, and you seem to have it. I was
thinking over it this very morning.
&#8216;Lord, Lord,&#8217; sez I to myself, &#8216;if Dan
Dolan hadn&#8217;t gone and got that eddycation
bug in his head, wouldn&#8217;t this be
the chance for him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Dan; but there
was not much eagerness in his question.
Wide and springy as was the butcher&#8217;s
cart, it did not appeal to him as a
chariot of fortune just now. A loin of
beef dangled over his head, a dead calf
was stretched out on the straw behind
him. Pete&#8217;s white apron was stained
with blood. Dan was conscious of a
dull, sick repulsion of body and soul.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s this,&#8221; continued Pete,
cheerfully. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve made a little
money over there at my corner, and
I&#8217;m planning to spread out,&mdash;do things
bigger and broader. There ain&#8217;t no
sort of use in holding back to hams and
shoulders when ye can buy yer hogs on
the hoof. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m in fur
now,&mdash;hogs on the hoof; cut &#8217;em, corn
&#8217;em, smoke &#8217;em, salt &#8217;em, souse &#8217;em,
grind &#8217;em into sausage meat and headcheese
and scrapple, boil &#8217;em into lard.
Why, a hog is a regular gold mine when
he is handled right. But I can&#8217;t
handle it in that little corner shop I&#8217;ve
got now: there&#8217;s no room fur it. But
it&#8217;s too good a business there fur me
to give up. So I&#8217;m going to open
another place further out, and keep
both a-going. And I can&#8217;t afford no
high-class bookkeeper or clerk, that will
maybe jump my trade and gobble all
my profits. What I want is a boy,&mdash;a
bright, wide-awake boy that knows
enough about figguring to keep my accounts,
and see that no one &#8216;does&#8217; me,&mdash;a
boy that I can send round in the
wagon to buy and sell &#8217;cording to my
orders,&mdash;a boy that will be smart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
enough to pick up the whole business
from <i>a</i> to <i>izzard</i>, and work up as I
worked up till I kin make him partner.
That&#8217;s the chance I&#8217;ve got, and I believe
you&#8217;re the boy to take it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I would have to give up college
of course,&#8221; said Dan, slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give up college!&#8221; echoed Pete.
&#8220;Well, I should rather say you would!
There ain&#8217;t no time fur books in a biz
like mine. Now, Dan, what&#8217;s the good
of college anyhow fur a chap like you?
It ain&#8217;t ez if you were one of these
high mug-a-mugs with a rich father to
pay yer way through, and set you up
in a white choker and swallow-tail coat
afterwards. What&#8217;s the good of a
strong, husky fellow fooling along with
Latin and Greek, that will never be no
use to him? You&#8217;d a heap better spiel
plain strong English that will bring
you in the spondulics. Why, look at
me! I never had two years&#8217; schooling
in my life. It&#8217;s all I can do to scrawl
&#8216;P. J. Patterson,&#8217; so folks can read it,
and thump out the rest on a secondhand
typewriter. But that &#8217;ere same
scrawl will bring five thousand dollars
out of the bank any time I want it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
If I had as much eddycation as you
have, Dan, nobody couldn&#8217;t keep me in
any school in the land another minute.
It&#8217;s all nonsense,&mdash;a dead waste of time
and money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you pay me?&#8221; asked
Dan, as the big loin of beef above joggled
against his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, let me see!&#8221; considered Pete.
&#8220;I ain&#8217;t paying any fancy price at start,
fur I don&#8217;t know how things will work
out; but I won&#8217;t be mean with you,
Dan. What do you say to four dollars
a week and board?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Dan, promptly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t want your board at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t?&#8221; said Pete in surprise.
&#8220;It will be good board, Dan: no fancy
fixings but filling, I promise you
that,&mdash;good and filling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care how filling it is,&#8221;
answered Dan, gruffly. &#8220;I&#8217;d want my
own board, with Aunt Winnie. That&#8217;s
all I&#8217;d come to you for,&mdash;to take care of
Aunt Winnie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t they good to her where she
is?&#8221; asked Pete, who knew something
of the family history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Dan; &#8220;but she is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
not happy: she is homesick, and I
want to bring her&mdash;home.&#8221;</p>
<p>And something in the tone of the
boyish voice told Pete that, with Aunt
Winnie and a home, Dan would be secured
as his faithful henchman forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got an old mother myself, and if I took
her out of her little cubby-hole of a
house and put her in the marble halls
that folks sing about, she&#8217;d be pining.
It&#8217;s women nature, specially old women.
Can&#8217;t tear &#8217;em up by the roots when
they&#8217;re past sixty. And that old aunt
of yours has been good to you sure,&mdash;good
as a mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Dan, a little
huskily, &#8220;good as a mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you oughtn&#8217;t to go back on
her sure,&#8221; said Pete, reflectively. &#8220;Considering
the old lady, I&#8217;ll make it five
dollars a week, if you&#8217;ll agree for a
year ahead, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A year ahead!&#8221; echoed Dan, thinking
of all that year had promised him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Pete, decidedly. &#8220;It must
be a year ahead. I can&#8217;t break you in
at such a big figger, and then hev you
bolt the track just as I&#8217;ve got used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
you. I wouldn&#8217;t give five dollars a
week to any other boy in the world,
though I know lots of &#8217;em would jump
at it. It&#8217;s only thinking of that old
mother of mine and how I&#8217;d feel in your
place, makes me offer it to you. Five
dollars a week will bring your Aunt
Winnie back home. And, between you
and me, Dan, if she ain&#8217;t brought back,
she&#8217;ll be in another sort of home before
long, and past your helping. Mrs. Mulligan
was telling me the other day that
she had been out to see her, and she
was looking mighty peaked and feeble,&mdash;not
complaining of course, but
just pining away natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When will you want me?&#8221; blurted
out Dan, desperately. &#8220;Right off
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; was the hasty answer.
&#8220;I haven&#8217;t got the other place open yet,
and this &#8217;ere hot weather ain&#8217;t no time
fur it. I&#8217;m just laying plans for the
fall. What were you thinking of doing
this summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Going off with a lot of fellows to the
seashore. But I&#8217;m ready to give it up,&#8221;
answered Dan, gulping down the lump
that rose in his throat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t,&mdash;don&#8217;t!&#8221; said Pete. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t got things fixed for a start yet.
Won&#8217;t have them fixed for a couple of
months or so. I ain&#8217;t a-hurrying you.
Just you think this &#8217;ere chance over,
and make up your mind whether it
ain&#8217;t wuth more than all that Greek
and Latin they&#8217;re stuffing into your
head at Saint Andrew&#8217;s. Then come
around somewhere about the first of
September and see me &#8217;bout it. I won&#8217;t
go back on my offer. It will be five
dollars cash down every Saturday
night, and no renigging. I turn off
here,&#8221; concluded Pete, drawing up as
they reached a busy corner. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
have to jump down; so bye, bye, Dan
my boy, until I see you again! Remember
it&#8217;s five dollars a week, and a
home for Aunt Winnie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll remember,&#8221; said Dan, as, half
dazed, he jumped from the wagon and
took his way back to Saint Andrew&#8217;s.</p>
<p>He entered the cross-crowned gateway
that guarded the spacious grounds,
feeling like one in a troubled dream.
He could shape nothing clearly: his
past, present, and future seemed shaken
out of place like the vari-colored figures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
of a kaleidoscope. To give up all his
hopes, to shut out the beautiful vista
opening before him and settle down
forever to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8220;hogs on the hoof!&#8221;
And yet it was his only chance to cheer,
to gladden, perhaps to save gentle Aunt
Win&#8217;s life,&mdash;to bring her home again.</p>
<p>But would she be happy at such a
sacrifice? Would she not grieve even at
the fireside she had regained over her
broken dreams? And Dan would come
down from his dreams and visions
(which, after all, are very vague and
uncertain things for boys of thirteen)
to Tabby and the teapot, to the fluttering
old hand in his clasp, the trembling
old voice in his ear.</p>
<p>The sun was close to its setting;
supper was over, he knew; and Jim
Norris was waiting impatiently for his
promised game. But he could not think
of tennis just now; still less was he
disposed for a meeting with Dud Fielding,
whose voice he could hear beyond
the box hedge at his right. So, turning
away from tennis court and playground,
Dan plunged into the quiet
shelter of the walk that skirted the
high, ivy-grown wall, and was already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
growing dim with evening shadows,
though lances of sunlight glinting here
and there through the arching pines
broke the gloom.</p>
<p>Pacing the quiet way with feeble step
was an old priest, saying his Office.
Father Mack&#8217;s earthly work was done.
He could no longer preach or teach;
he was only lingering in the friendly
shadows of Saint Andrew&#8217;s, waiting his
Master&#8217;s call home; his long, busy life
ending in a sweet twilight peace.
Sometimes at retreats or on great
feasts, when there was a crowd of juvenile
penitents in the college chapel,
Father Mack, gentle and indulgent, had
his place in a quiet corner, where he
was rather avoided by young sinners
as a &#8220;dying saint.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dan, whatever might be his
month&#8217;s record of wrong-doing, had
taken to Father Mack from the first.
Perhaps it was something in the Irish
voice that recalled Aunt Winnie; perhaps
some deeper sympathy between
souls akin. Though they seldom met,
for the old priest had his room in a
building remote from the students&#8217;
quarters, Father Mack and Dan were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
fast friends. His presence here was
most unlooked for; and Dan was about
to retire without further intrusion,
when the old priest closed his book and
turned to him with a kindly nod.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t run off. I&#8217;m done,
my boy. These long, hot days are a
bit hard on me; but I like to stay out
here in the evening to say my Office
and watch the sunset. Did you ever
watch the sunset, Danny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Father,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;It&#8217;s
great.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see in it, Danny?&#8221;
was the low question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all sorts of things, Father,&mdash;domes
and spires and banners of gold
and red and purple, and pillars of cloud
and fire&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And gates,&#8221; broke in Father Mack.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see the gates, Danny,&mdash;gates
that seem to open in the shining
way that leads to God&#8217;s Throne? Ah,
it&#8217;s a wonderful sight, the sunset, when
your day is near done and you are tired
and old,&mdash;too old to be picturing and
dreaming. I&#8217;ll soon see&mdash;beyond the
cloud and the dream, Danny,&mdash;I&#8217;ll soon
see.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>The old man paused for a moment,
his dim eye kindling, his withered face
rapt. Then suddenly, as if recalled
from some cloudy height to earth, his
look and voice changed into fatherly
interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you looking for me,&mdash;were
you wanting to talk to me, my son?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;yes&mdash;no,&#8221; faltered Dan, who
had not thought of such a thing.
&#8220;Well, yes, I believe I do. I&#8217;m all muddled
up, and maybe you can set me
right, Father Mack. For&mdash;for,&#8221; Dan
blurted out without further hesitation,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t see things clear myself. Aunt
Winnie is grieving and pining and
homesick at the Little Sisters. She is
trying to hide it, but she is grieving,
I know. She broke down and cried to-day
when I went to see her,&mdash;cried
real sobs and tears. And&mdash;and&#8221; Dan
went on with breathless haste, &#8220;Peter
Patterson, that keeps the meatshop at
our old corner, has offered me five
dollars a week to come and work for
him. To give up Saint Andrew&#8217;s&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;all
it means, Father Mack, and
work for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>VI.&mdash;Father Mack.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Give up Saint Andrew&#8217;s!&#8221; repeated
Father Mack in a low, startled voice.
&#8220;You, Dan! Give up!  Oh, no, my
boy,&mdash;no!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aunt Winnie will die if I don&#8217;t,&#8221;
blurted out Dan, despairingly. &#8220;Pete
Patterson says so. And I can take her
home and give her back her little rooms
over Mulligans&#8217;, and the blue teapot
and Tabby, and everything she loves.
And Pete says I can work up to be his
partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His partner,&mdash;his partner! In
what?&#8221; asked Father Mack, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meat business,&#8221; answered Dan.
&#8220;He&#8217;s made money, and he&#8217;s going in
for it big,&mdash;corning, smoking, sausage,
everything. I&mdash;I could take care of
Aunt Winnie fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meat business, sausage? I don&#8217;t
think I understand,&#8221; said Father Mack,
in bewilderment. &#8220;Sit down here, Dan,
and tell me all this over again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan took his seat on a broken slab
that had been a gravestone before the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
old college cemetery had been condemned
and removed beyond the limits
of the growing city. It was a very old
slab, bearing the Latin title of some
Brother or Father who had died fifty
years ago. The sunset fell through a
gap in the pines that showed the western
sky, with its open gates, their
pillars of cloud and fire all aglow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me slowly, calmly, Dan. My
ears are growing dull.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan told his story again, more
clearly and less impetuously; while
Father Mack listened, his bent head
haloed by the setting sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t let Aunt Winnie die,&#8221; concluded
Dan. &#8220;You see, I have to think
of Aunt Winnie, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see,&mdash;I see, my boy,&#8221; was the
low answer. &#8220;And it is only of Aunt
Winnie you are thinking, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only of Aunt Winnie,&#8221; replied Dan,
emphatically. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose anything
else would count against Saint
Andrew&#8217;s, Father. I&#8217;d work, I&#8217;d
starve, I&#8217;d die, I believe, rather than
give up my chance here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, it&#8217;s hard lines sometimes,&#8221;
said Father Mack. &#8220;You may find it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
even harder as the years go by, Dan.
I heard about the trouble yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you, Father?&#8221; said Dan,
somewhat abashed. &#8220;Dud Fielding did
stir the old Nick in me for sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Father Mack. &#8220;And that
same fierce spirit will be stirred again
and again, Dan. Despite all your
teachers can do for you, there will be
pricks and goads we can not help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; answered Dan, sturdily.
&#8220;I&#8217;m ready for them. Saint Andrew&#8217;s
is worth all the pricks and goads I&#8217;ll
get. But Aunt Winnie, Father,&mdash;I
can&#8217;t forget Aunt Winnie. I&#8217;ve got to
take Aunt Winnie back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would she&mdash;wish it, at such&mdash;such
a cost, Dan?&#8221; Father Mack questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cost,&#8221; repeated Dan, simply. &#8220;It
wouldn&#8217;t cost much. The rooms are
only a dollar a week, and Aunt Winnie
can make stirabout and Irish stews and
potato cake to beat any cook I know.
Three dollars a week would feed us fine.
And there would be a dollar to spare.
And she could have her teapot on the
stove again, and Tabby on the hearth-rug,
only&mdash;only&#8221; (the young face
clouded a little) &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid great as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
it all would be, she&#8217;d be grieving about
her dreams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her dreams!&#8221; echoed Father Mack,
a little puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;You see, I am all
she has in the world, and she is awful
soft on me, and since I got into Saint
Andrew&#8217;s she&#8217;s softer still. She thinks
there&#8217;s nothing too great or grand for
me to do. My, it would make you
laugh, Father, to hear poor old Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s pipe dreams about a tough
chap like me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does she dream, Dan?&#8221; asked
the old priest softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose she&#8217;d get out of them if
she were home where things are
natural like,&#8221; said Dan; &#8220;but now she
sits up there in the Little Sisters&#8217;
dreaming that I&#8217;m going to be a
priest,&mdash;a rough-and-tumble fellow like
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stranger things than that have happened,
Dan,&#8221; said Father Mack, quietly.
&#8220;I was a rough-and-tumble fellow myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Father!&#8221; exclaimed Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;roughest-and-tumblest&#8217; kind,&#8221;
said Father Mack, his worn face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
brightening into a smile that took away
twenty years at least. &#8220;I ran away to
sea, Dan, leaving a gentle mother to
break her heart for me. When I came
back&#8221; (the old face shadowed again)
&#8220;she was gone. Ah, God&#8217;s ways are
full of mystery, Dan! I think it was
that made me a priest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Father Mack was silent for a moment.
His dim eyes turned to the sunset,
where the cloud curtains were
swept asunder, the pillared gates a
glory of crimson and gold. Something
in his old friend&#8217;s face hushed Dan&#8217;s
questioning until Father Mack spoke
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was a long time ago,&mdash;a long
time ago. But the thought of it makes
me understand about Aunt Winnie,
Dan, and how hard it is to give you up.
Still&mdash;still&mdash;even of old God asked the
firstlings of the flock. Sacrifice! sacrifice!
It is the way to heaven, Dan.
Heart, hopes, tears, blood,&mdash;always
sacrifice.&#8221; And again the old speaker
paused as if in troubled thought.
&#8220;How soon must you make your choice,
Dan?&#8221; he asked at length.</p>
<p>&#8220;My choice?  About leaving, you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
mean, Father? Oh, Pete Patterson
doesn&#8217;t want me until the fall. And I
haven&#8217;t any place to go this summer,
if I give up now. Father Regan is
going to send us off to-morrow with
Brother Bart for a summer at the seashore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A summer at the seashore! Ah,
good, good,&mdash;very good!&#8221; said Father
Mack, his old face brightening. &#8220;That
will give us time to think, to pray, Dan.
A summer! Ah, God can work wonders
for those who trust Him in a
summer, Dan! Think what He does
with the seed, the grain, the fruit. It
is not well to move or to choose hastily
when we are in the dark as to God&#8217;s
will. So say nothing about all this to
any one as yet, Dan,&mdash;nothing this
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t, Father,&#8221; agreed Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I promise that every day you
will be remembered in my Mass, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Father! That ought to
keep me out of trouble sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And now where is this seashore
place?&#8221; asked Father Mack, quite
cheerfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;An island called Killykinick,
Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Killykinick?&#8221; echoed Father Mack,
startled. &#8220;You are going to Killykinick?
God bless me, how wonderful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know the place, Father?&#8221;
asked Dan, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it indeed,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;I was wrecked there in the wild days
of which I told you, Dan, sixty years
ago. The &#8216;Maria Teresa&#8217; (I was on a
Portuguese ship) went upon the rocks
on a dark winter night, that I thought
was likely to be my last. For the first
time in my reckless youth I really
prayed. My dear mother, no doubt,
was praying for me, too; for I learned
afterwards that it was on that night
she died, offering with her last breath
her life for her boy. Well, we held
together somehow until morning, and
got off to the shore of Killykinick before
the &#8216;Maria Teresa&#8217; went down,
loaded with the golden profits of a two
years&#8217; cruise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And did they never get her up?&#8221;
asked Dan, quite breathless with interest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
at this glimpse of a &#8220;dying
saint&#8217;s&#8221; past.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; answered Father Mack,&mdash;&#8220;at
least never that I heard of. It was
soon afterward that I turned into
other ways and lost sight of my old
mates. But I always have remembered
the friendly haven of Killykinick. It
was a wild place,&mdash;only a few deserted
fishermen&#8217;s huts on the rocky shore,
where we lived on fish and clams until
taken off by a passing ship. But that
same rocky shore meant safety, shelter,
life. And so in the after years I have
always blessed Killykinick. And you
are going there to-morrow! You will
find it all changed,&mdash;all changed, I am
sure,&#8221; said Father Mack, as he slowly
rose to his feet, for the sunset was fading
now. &#8220;But I will think of you
there, Dan,&mdash;think of you frolicking
over the rocks and sands where
I wandered so long ago a shipwrecked
boy. Now it is time for me to go in,
for my old blood chills in the twilight;
so I must say good-bye,&mdash;good-bye and
God bless you, my boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, laying his hand for a moment
on the boyish head, the old priest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
turned away into the deepening
shadow of the pines, leaving Dan, who
was beginning to feel vividly conscious
that he had missed his supper, to make
a rapid foray into the refectory, where
Brother James could always be beguiled
into furnishing bread and jam in and
out of time,&mdash;having been, as he assured
the belated ones, a boy himself.</p>
<p>There was another belated one this
evening. Seated before a tempting
spread of milk toast, demanded by his
recent convalescence, was Freddy
Neville, a little pale and peaked perhaps,
but doing full justice to a third
creamy slice, and ready for more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello, Fred!&#8221; greeted Dan,
dropping into the chair beside him.
&#8220;You down?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Fred, spooning his dish
vigorously. &#8220;I&#8217;m well, all right now.
Temperature gone, Brother Tim says.
Can&#8217;t I have a little more toast,
Brother James, please? I&#8217;m not half
filled up yet. Supper tastes twice as
good down here. I&#8217;ve been out with
Brother Bart buying shoes and things
to go to Killykinick, and I&#8217;m hungry as
a bear.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a bit then, and I&#8217;ll bring ye
both in some strawberry jam and biscuits,&#8221;
said Brother James, good-humoredly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the black fast
Brother Tim puts on sick boys, I know.
When they came down after the measles
I couldn&#8217;t get them enough to eat for a
month. There now!&#8221; And the good
man set forth supplies liberally. &#8220;I
know what it is. I&#8217;ve been a hungry
boy myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing, it&#8217;s good to be up and out
again!&#8221; said Freddy, as both boys
pitched into biscuits and jam. &#8220;I felt
down and out this morning sure, Dan,
and now everything is working fine.
We&#8217;re going to have the time of our
lives this summer, after all. Even Dud
Fielding is cooling off, Jim Norris says,
now that his nose has gone down, and
he has heard about Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who told him?&#8221; asked Dan, who
did not feel particularly cheered at
these tidings; for Dud&#8217;s &#8220;cooling off&#8221;
was by no means to be trusted, as he
knew.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Regan, of course. He
couldn&#8217;t send the boys unless they
wanted to go. But when they heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
about the old house uncle made out of
his ship, and the row-boats and the
sailboat, and the bathing and fishing,
they just jumped at the chance to go.
And Jim says there is a fine place not
far off, where Dud spent the season
two years ago with some tip toppers,
and he&#8217;s counting on getting in with
them again. So he is tickled all around.
But I&#8217;m not caring about Dud or what
he likes, so long as I&#8217;ve got you, Dan,
I wouldn&#8217;t want to go without you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t you, kid?&#8221; asked Dan,
softly, for, after all the troubles and
perplexities of the day, his little chum&#8217;s
trusting friendship seemed very sweet
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;N-o-o-o!&#8221; answered Freddy, most
decidedly. &#8220;But I sort of wish Brother
Bart was not going. He&#8217;ll keep me
such a baby!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll see to that,&#8221;
said Dan, with a twinkle in his eye.
&#8220;If there&#8217;s any way of giving you a
good time, I&#8217;ll do it. And I won&#8217;t let
you get hurt again either,&mdash;no sir!
I&#8217;ve had my scare about that. I&#8217;m going
to look out for you right. It may
be for the last time, but&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The last time,&#8221; interrupted Freddy
quickly. &#8220;Why will it be the last
time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I may never have a chance
at such a jolly holiday again,&#8221;
answered Dan, suddenly remembering
his promise to Father Mack. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll make this one a hummer. If
Killykinick is half what I think it is,
we&#8217;ll make this chance a hummer you&#8217;ll
never forget.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>VII.&mdash;A Holiday Start.</p>
</div>

<p>And the holiday proved to be a
&#8220;hummer&#8221; from the very start. Everybody
was in high spirits. Even Dud
Fielding, with his nose happily reduced
to its normal color and size, had lost
his &#8220;grouch,&#8221; and was quite himself
again, in a sporting suit of English
tweed, ordered from his tailors for
&#8220;roughing it.&#8221; Easy-going Jim was in
comfortable khaki; so was little Fred;
while Dan had been privately presented
by the Brother wardrobian with
two suits of the same,&mdash;&#8220;left by
boys for the poor,&#8221; good Brother Francis
had whispered confidentially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fill the bill then, sure,&#8221; said Dan,
with a cheerful grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do, but many a fine man has
done the same before you,&#8221; answered
Brother Francis, nodding. &#8220;I&#8217;ve put a
few more things in your trunk, Dan;
take them and God bless you! I&#8217;ve cut
off the marks so nobody&#8217;ll be the
wiser.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brother Bart&#8217;s wrinkled face wore a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
glow of pleasurable excitement as,
after seeing the baggage off, he marshalled
his holiday force on the college
porch for the last words of command
from his reverend chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give your orders now, Father;
though God knows how I&#8217;ll be able to
keep this lot up to them. They are
not to be killing and drowning themselves
against my will and word.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly not,&#8221; said Father Regan,
with a smile. &#8220;Brother Bart is to be
obeyed, boys, or you&#8217;ll promptly be
ordered home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there is to be no roving off wid
pirates and smugglers that may be
doing their devilment along the shore,&#8221;
continued Brother Bart, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government looks out for all
that now,&#8221; laughed Father Regan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure,&#8221; said Brother
Bart, who had grown up in a wild
stretch of the Irish coast. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
wicked world, and we&#8217;re going beyant
the Lord&#8217;s light that shines on us here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&#8221; was the cheering assurance.
&#8220;Beach Cliff is only six miles
away, and it has a little church where
there is a Mass every Sunday.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord be praised for that anyhow!&#8221;
said the good man, with a sigh
of relief. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great burthen that
ye&#8217;ve put on my body and soul, Father.
But I&#8217;ll do me best, and, with God&#8217;s
help, I&#8217;ll bring the four of them back
safe and sound to ye. Now give us
your blessing and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>And very soon they were off indeed,
speeding on to the busy wharf, scene of
many a &#8220;lark&#8221; in Dan&#8217;s boyish past.
Here the great steamboat was awaiting
them: for, although the route was
longer and more circuitous, Father Regan
had decided it best for his young
travellers to make their journey by sea.</p>
<p>To Jim and Dud such a trip was no
novelty; even Freddy had taken more
than one holiday outing with Uncle
Tom; but to Dan&mdash;Dan whose busy,
workaday childhood had excluded even
the delights of a cheap excursion&mdash;everything
was wonderfully and deliciously
new. He felt like one in a
bewildering dream. As the great floating
palace, all aglitter and aglow with
splendors of paint and upholstery
hitherto unknown, swung from her
moorings out into the stream, Dan
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
quite forgot the gentility of his surroundings
and the elegant Dud Fielding
at his elbow, and waved his hat with a
wild &#8220;Hurrah&#8221; to half a dozen Wharf
Rats who were fishing off the pier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan!&#8221; rose the shrill-voiced
chorus, and six pairs of bare legs
dangling over the water scrambled up
to a stand. &#8220;Jing! if it ain&#8217;t Dan
Dolan,&mdash;Dan Dolan all diked up like a
swell! Hi-yi-yi-yi, Dan! Where are
you going, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seashore, New England, Killykinick!&#8221;
Dan shouted back, quite unconscious
of the smiles and stares of the
passengers. &#8220;Off for the summer!
Hooray!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray&mdash;hooray!&#8221; with a series of
whoops and catcalls came back the
Wharf Rat&#8217;s farewells, echoing with
such friendly memories of a rough past
that Dan was struck speechless by the
fierce contrasting voice in his ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You darned dunderhead!&#8221; whispered
Dud Fielding. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you keep
quiet in a decent crowd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221; said Dan in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you see everybody staring at
us?&#8221; continued Dud, wrathfully. &#8220;To
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
be shouting at dirty little beggars like
those and disgracing us all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Disgracing you?&#8221; echoed Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dud, still hot with pride
and rage. &#8220;And there are the Fosters
on the upper deck,&mdash;people I know.
Come, Jim, let&#8217;s cut off before they see
us with this low-down chump.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dud led easy-going Jim to the
other side of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Low-down chump!&#8221; Unconscious
as he was of any offense, Dan felt the
scornful sting of the words, and his
hot blood began to boil; but he remembered
the &#8220;pricks and goads&#8221; he
had resolved to bear bravely, and shut
his lips tight together as Freddy stole
a small hand into his own.</p>
<p>With the last &#8220;Hi-yi&#8221; the Wharf
Rats had settled back to their occupation,
and Freddy eyed them from the
growing distance most favorably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever fish like that, Dan?&#8221;
he asked with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Often,&#8221; was the brief reply; for
Dan was still hot and sore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly, it must be fun! And did you
catch anything, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dinner,&#8221; answered Dan, grimly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; exclaimed Freddy, breathlessly.
&#8220;That was great! When we get
to Killykinick let us go out like those
bare legged boys and catch our dinner,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan laughed and forgot he was
a &#8220;low-down chump&#8221; as he agreed
they would catch dinners whenever
possible. Then he and Freddy proceeded
to explore the big boat high and
low, decks, cabins, saloons, machinery
wherever visible. Freddy, who had
made similar explorations with Uncle
Tom as guide, was quite posted in
steamboat workings; but it was all
new and wonderful to Dan, who had
only dry book-knowledge of levers and
cogs and wheels; and to watch them
in action, to gaze down into the fiery
depths of the furnace, to hear the
mighty throb of the giant engine,&mdash;to
see all these fierce forces mastered by
rules and laws into the benignant
power that was bearing him so gently
over summer seas, held him breathless
with interest and delight. Even the
clang of the first dinner gong could not
distract him from his study of cylinder
and piston and shaft and driving-rod,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
and all shining mechanism working
without pause or jar at man&#8217;s command.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as if they had sense,&#8221; said
Dan, thoughtfully,&mdash;&#8220;a heap more
sense than lots of living folk I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Uncle Tom says,&#8221; replied
Freddy, to whom, in their brief
holidays together, Uncle Tom, cheery
and loving, was an authority beyond
question. &#8220;He says they work by strict
law and rule, and people won&#8217;t. They
shirk and kick. Jing! if these here
engines took to shirking and kicking
where would we be? But they don&#8217;t
shirk and kick against law. Uncle Tom
says they obey, and that&#8217;s what boys
ought to do&mdash;obey. Gee! it&#8217;s good
we&#8217;re not engines, isn&#8217;t it, Dan? We&#8217;d
blow things sky high.&mdash;Here&#8217;s the
second call for dinner,&#8221; said Freddy,
roused from these serious reflections by
the sound of the gong. &#8220;We&#8217;d better
move quick, Dan, or the ice-cream may
give out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you have ice-cream,&mdash;all you
want?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no,&#8221; hesitated Freddy, who
knew what Dan could do in that line,&mdash;&#8220;not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
like we have at college. They
dish it out other places a little skimp,
but they&#8217;ll give you a good supply of
other things to make up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which information Dan soon found
to be most pleasantly correct; and,
though the glories of the long dining
room, with its corps of low-voiced
waiters, were at first a trifle embarrassing,
and Brother Bart&#8217;s grace,
loudly defying all human respect, attracted
some attention to his table, the
boys did full justice to the good things
set so deftly before them, and went
through the bill of fare most successfully.</p>
<p>The black waiters grinned as the
young travellers proceeded to top off
with apple pie and ice-cream, combined
in such generous proportions that
Brother Bart warned them that the sin
of gluttony would be on their souls if
they ate another mouthful.</p>
<p>Then Freddy, sorely against his will,
was borne off by his good old friend to
rest, according to Brother Tim&#8217;s last
order; while Dan was left to himself
to watch the boat turning into the
shore, where a wharf loaded with truck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
for shipping jutted out into the stream;
and one passenger&mdash;a sturdy, grizzled
man in rough, brown hunting corduroy&mdash;leaped
aboard followed by two
fine dogs. Then the laboring engines,
with puff and shriek, kept on their
way; while Dan continued his investigations,
and made friendly overtures to
a big deck hand who volunteered to
show the eager young questioner
&#8220;below.&#8221;</p>
<p>And &#8220;below&#8221; they went, down steep,
crooked steps that led away from all
the glitter and splendor above, into
black depths, lit only by fierce glow of
undying fires. Brawny, half-naked
figures fed and stirred the roaring
flames; the huge boilers hissed, the engines
panted; but through all the darkness
and discord came the measured
beat of the ship&#8217;s pulse that told there
was no shirk or kick,&mdash;that all this
mighty mechanism was &#8220;obeying.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, this dark sight-seeing
over, Dan came up again into the
bright, sunlit deck crowded with gay
passengers chatting and laughing.
Brother Bart was making efforts at
conversation with an old French priest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
returning to his mission in the Canadian
forests; Dud had introduced Jim
to his fashionable friends, and both
boys were enjoying a box of chocolates
with pretty little Minnie Foster;
Freddy was still &#8220;resting&#8221; in his stateroom.</p>
<p>All were unmindful of the dark, fiery
depths below, where fierce powers were
working so obediently to bear them on
their happy, sunlit way, that was widening
each moment now. The smiling
shores, dotted with farms and villages,
were stretching away into hazy distance;
there was a new swell in the
waves as they felt the heart-beat of the
sea. It was all new and wonderful to
Dan; and he stood leaning on the deck
rail of a secluded corner made by a
projecting cabin, watching the sunset
glory pale over the swift vanishing
shore, when he was suddenly startled
by a deep voice near him that questioned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Worth seeing, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan looked up and saw the big grizzled
stranger in corduroy gazing at the
splendor of the western sky.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;It&#8217;s
great! Are we out at sea now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;Not in
the full swell yet, but this is our last
sight of land.&#8221; He nodded to a promontory
where the delicate lines of a
lighthouse were faintly pencilled
against the sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; said Dan, drawing a long
breath, &#8220;it feels queer to be leaving
earth and sun and everything behind
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>His companion laughed a little
harshly. &#8220;I suppose it does at your
age,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Afterwards&#8221; (he stopped
to light a cigar and puff it into
glow),&mdash;&#8220;afterwards we get used to
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; assented Dan, &#8220;because
we know we are coming back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming back!&#8221; repeated the other
slowly. &#8220;We are not always sure of
that. Sometimes we leave the land, the
light, behind us forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not forever!&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;We
would have to strike light and land
somewhere unless we drowned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t drown,&#8221; continued the
stranger. &#8220;We do worse: we drift,&mdash;drift
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
in darkness and night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan stared. His companion had
taken his cigar from his lips and was
letting its glow die into ashes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Folks do drown sometimes,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;I tell you if you go round the
bottom of this boat you&#8217;d see how we
could drown mighty easily. Just a
wheel or crank or a valve a mite
wrong,&mdash;whewy! we&#8217;d all be done for.
But they don&#8217;t go wrong; that&#8217;s the
wonder of it, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Dan, cheerfully.
&#8220;If everybody kept steady and
straight as a steam-engine, this would
be a mighty good world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt it would,&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;Are you not rather young to be facing
it alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not alone!&#8221; said Dan,
hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;m off with a lot of other
fellows for the seashore. We are college
boys from Saint Andrew&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saint Andrew&#8217;s?&#8221; The stranger
started so violently that the dying cigar
dropped from his hold. &#8220;Saint Andrew&#8217;s
College, you say, boy! Not
Saint Andrew&#8217;s in&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But a clear young voice broke in
upon the excited question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan! Where are you, Dan?
Oh, I&#8217;ve been looking everywhere for
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, fresh and rosy from his long
rest, Freddy Neville bounded out gleefully
to Dan&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>A low cry burst from the stranger&#8217;s
lips, and he stood staring at the boys as
if turned into stone.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>VIII.&mdash;A New Friend.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Jing, you gave me a scare, Dan!&#8221;
said Freddy, drawing a long breath of
relief. &#8220;I thought you had dropped
overboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overboard!&#8221; scoffed Dan. &#8220;You
must think I&#8217;m a ninny. And you have
been sleeping sure! Got to keep this
sort of thing up all summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; said Freddy; &#8220;only for
a few days,&mdash;until I get real well and
strong; though Brother Bart will keep
fussing over me, I know. Golly, I wish
we had Uncle Tom along with us!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, is he?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221; replied Freddy, emphatically.
&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t baby you a bit; lets you
row and swim and dive when you go
off with him. Most as good as a real
father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Just</i> as good, I guess,&#8221; amended
Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Freddy, shaking his head.
&#8220;You see, he has other work&mdash;preaching
and saying Mass and giving missions&mdash;where
I don&#8217;t come in. He has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
to leave me at Saint Andrew&#8217;s because
he hasn&#8217;t any home. It must be just
fine to have a home that isn&#8217;t a school,&mdash;a
sort of cosy little place, with
cushioned chairs, and curtains, and a
fire that you can see, and a kitchen
where you can roast nuts and apples
and smell gingerbread baking, and a
big dog that would be your very own.
But you can&#8217;t have a home like that
when you have a priest uncle like mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed Dan, his
thoughts turning to Aunt Winnie and
her blue teapot, and the little rooms
that, despite all the pinch and poverty,
she had made home.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Christmas,&#8221; went on Freddy,
both young speakers being quite oblivious
of the big stranger who had
seated himself on a camp stool in the
shelter of the projecting cabin, and,
with folded arms resting on the deck
rail, was apparently studying the distant
horizon,&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;d like to have one
real right Christmas before I get too
big for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me you have a pretty
good time as it is,&#8221; remarked Dan:
&#8220;new skates and sled, and five dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
pocket money. There wasn&#8217;t a fellow
at the school of your age had any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Freddy; &#8220;but they
went <i>home</i>. A fellow doesn&#8217;t want
pocket money when he goes home.
Dick Fenton had only sixty cents; I
lent him fifteen more to get a card-case
for his mother. But he had
Christmas all right, you bet: a tree
that went to the ceiling (he helped to
cut it down himself); all the house
&#8216;woodsy&#8217; with wreaths and berries and
fires,&mdash;real fires where you could pop
corn and roast apples. He lives in the
country, you see, where money doesn&#8217;t
count; for you can&#8217;t buy a real Christmas;
it has to be homemade,&#8221; said
Freddy, with a little sigh. &#8220;So I&#8217;ll
never have one, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the great gong sounded again
to announce supper; and both boys
bounded away to find the rest of their
crowd, leaving the big stranger still
seated in the gathering darkness,
looking out to sea. As the boyish footsteps
died into silence, he bowed his
head upon his hands, and his breast
heaved with a long, shuddering breath
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
as if some dull, slumbering pain had
wakened into life again. Then, in
fierce self-mastery, he rose, stretched
his tall form to its full height, and,
ascending to the upper deck, began to
pace its dimming length with the
stern, swift tread of one whose life is
a restless, joyless march through a
desert land.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Brother Bart and his
boys had begun to feel the roll of the
sea, and to realize that supper had
been a mistake. Jim and Dud had retired
to their staterooms, with unpleasant
memories of Minnie Foster&#8217;s
chocolates, and the firm conviction
that they never wanted to see a candy
box again. Brother Bart was ministering
to a very white-faced &#8220;laddie,&#8221;
and thanking Heaven he was in the
state of grace and prepared for the
worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord&#8217;s will be done, but I
don&#8217;t think any of us will live to see
the morning. There must have been
some poison in the food, to take us all
suddint like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Brother Bart!&#8221; gasped
Freddy, faintly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been this way
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
before. We&#8217;re all just&mdash;just seasick,
Brother Bart&mdash;dead seasick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Dan had a few qualms,&mdash;just
enough to send him, with the sturdy
sense of his rough kind, out into the
widest sweep of briny air within his
reach. He made for a flight of stairs
that led up into some swaying, starlit
region where there were no other sufferers,
and flung himself upon a pile
of life-preservers that served as a
pillow for his dizzy head. Sickness of
any sort was altogether new to Dan,
and he felt it would be some relief to
groan out his present misery unheard.
But the glow of a cigar, whose owner
was pacing the deck, suddenly glimmered
above his head, and the big
man in corduroy nearly stumbled over
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Down and out,
my boy? Here, take a swig of this!&#8221;
and he handed out a silver-mounted
flask.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Dan, faintly, &#8220;&mdash;can&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve
taken the pledge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! Don&#8217;t be a fool, boy, when
you&#8217;re sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t touch it if I were dying,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
said Dan. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting better
now, anyhow. My, but I felt queer
for a while! It is so hot and stuffy
below. No more packing in on a shelf
for me. I&#8217;ll stick it out here until
morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the others,&mdash;the little chap
who was with you?&#8221; the stranger
asked hastily. &#8220;Is he&mdash;he sick, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Freddy Neville? Yes, dead sick;
but Brother Bart is looking out for
him. Brother Bart is a regular old
softy about Freddy. He took him
when he was a little kid and keeps
babying him yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is good to him, you mean?&#8221;
asked the other, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good? Well, I suppose you&#8217;d call
it good. I couldn&#8217;t stand any such
fussing. Why, when Fred got a tumble
in the gym the other day the old
man almost had a fit!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tumble,&mdash;a fall; did it hurt him
much?&#8221; There was a strange sharpness
in the questioner&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, no!&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;Just
knocked him out a little. But we were
all getting into trouble at Saint Andrew&#8217;s,
for vacation there is pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
slow; so Father Regan has sent us off
to the seashore for the summer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The seashore? Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some queer place called Killykinick,&#8221;
answered Dan, who was now
able to sit up and be sociable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killykinick?&#8221; repeated his companion,
in a startled tone. &#8220;Did you
say you were going to Killykinick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Freddy&#8217;s
uncle or cousin or somebody died a
while ago and left him a place there.
Freddy has a lot of houses and money
and things all his own. It&#8217;s lucky he
has. He isn&#8217;t the kind to rough it and
tough it for himself. Not that he
hasn&#8217;t plenty of grit,&#8221; went on
Freddy&#8217;s chum, hastily. &#8220;He&#8217;s as
plucky a little chap as I ever saw. But
he&#8217;s been used to having life soft and
easy. He is the &#8216;big bug&#8217; sort. (I
ain&#8217;t.) So I&#8217;m glad he has money
enough to make things smooth at the
start, though his no-&#8217;count father did
skip off and leave him when he was
only five years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His father left him?&#8221; repeated
Dan&#8217;s companion. &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
naturally a &#8216;quitter,&#8217; I guess. Lots of
menfolks are. Want a free foot and
no bother. But to shake a nice little
chap like Freddy I call a dirty, mean
trick, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There might be reasons,&#8221; was the
hesitating rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;What reason?&#8221; asked Dan, gruffly.
&#8220;There ain&#8217;t any sort of reason
why a father shouldn&#8217;t stick to his job.
I hate a &#8216;quitter,&#8217; anyhow,&#8221; concluded
Dan, decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you are twenty years
older before you say that, my boy!&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;Perhaps then you
will know what quitting costs and
means. But you&#8217;re an old chum for that
little boy. I saw him with you down
below. How is it that you&#8217;re such
friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Dan, being of a communicative
nature, and seeing no cause for
reserve, told his new acquaintance all
about the scholarship that had introduced
him into spheres of birth and
breeding to which he frankly confessed
he could make no claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not Freddy&#8217;s sort, I know;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
but he took to me somehow,&mdash;I can&#8217;t
tell why.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet as Dan went on with his simple,
honest story, his listener, who, world-wise
and world-weary as he was, knew
something of the boyish nature that
turns instinctively to what is strong
and true and good, felt he could tell
why Freddy took to this rough diamond
of a chum.</p>
<p>Dan, in his turn, learned that his
new acquaintance was called John
Wirt; that he was off on a vacation
trip, hunting and fishing wherever
there was promise of good sport; that
he had travelled abroad for several
years,&mdash;had been to China, Japan,
India, Egypt; had hunted lions and
elephants, seen the midnight sun,
crossed Siberian steppes and African
deserts. From a geographical standpoint,
Mr. Wirt&#8217;s story seemed an open
and extensive map, but biographically
it was a blank. Of his personal history,
past, present or future, he said
nothing. Altogether, Dan and his new
acquaintance had a pleasant hour on
the open deck beneath the stars, and
made friends rapidly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you were going our way,&#8221;
said Dan, regretfully, as his companion
announced that he was to get
off at the first point they touched.
&#8220;Brother Bart is going to granny us
all, I know. If we had a real strong
man like you around, he wouldn&#8217;t scare
so easily. And there is fine fishing
about Killykinick, they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I have heard.&#8221; The stranger had
risen now, and stood, a tall shadow
dimly outlined above Dan. &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;perhaps
I&#8217;ll drop in upon you. Isn&#8217;t it
time for you to turn in now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Dan,&mdash;&#8220;not into
that packing box below. I&#8217;m up here
for the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m off before morning, so it&#8217;s
good-bye and good luck to you!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with a friendly nod, Mr. John
Wirt strode away down the darkened
deck, leaving Dan to fling himself back
upon his life-preservers, and wonder
how, when, or where he had seen their
new acquaintance before,&mdash;not at Saint
Andrew&#8217;s; for Mr. Wirt had been
abroad, as he had said, ever since Dan
entered the college; not at Milligans&#8217;
or Pete Patterson&#8217;s, or anywhere about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
his old home. Perhaps he had blacked
his shoes or sold him a newspaper in
some half-forgotten past; for surely
there was something in his tone, his
glance, his friendly smile that Dan
knew.</p>
<p>He felt quite well now. All the dizziness
and nausea had vanished, and he
was his own strong, sturdy self again.
The roll and swap of the boat were
only the rock of a giant cradle; the
surge of the sea, a deep-toned lullaby
soothing him to pleasant dreams; and
the sky! Dan had never seen such a
midnight sky. He lay, with his head pillowed
in his clasped hands, looking up at
the starry splendor above him with a
wonder akin to awe. The great, blue
vault arching above him blazed with
light from a myriad stars, that his
books had told him were worlds greater
than this on whose wide waters he was
tossing now,&mdash;worlds whose history the
wisest of men could never know,&mdash;worlds,
thousands and millions of them,
moving in shining order by &#8220;rule and
law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rule and law,&#8221;&mdash;it was the lesson
that seemed to face Dan everywhere,&mdash;down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
in those black depths he had penetrated
to-day, where valve and lever
and gauge held roaring fire and hissing
steam, with all their fierce force,
to submission and service; in the polished
mechanism whose steady throb
he could feel pulsing beneath him like
a giant heart; in the radiant sky
where worlds beyond worlds swept on
their mysterious way&mdash;obeying.</p>
<p>With half-formed thoughts like these
stirring vaguely in his mind, Dan was
dropping off into pleasant sleep, when
he was roused by the sound of voices
and the glimmering of a ship&#8217;s lantern.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you will find your boy here,
sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Mr. John Wirt, who, with the
aid of a friendly deck hand, was guiding
a pale, tottering, very sick Brother
Bart to Dan&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who wants me?&#8221; asked the half-wakened
Dan, springing to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan! Ye young rapscallion!&#8221;
burst out Brother Bart, almost
sobbing in his relief. &#8220;It&#8217;s down at
the bottom of the black sea I thought
ye were. I&#8217;ve been tramping this boat,
with this good man holding me up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
(for I&#8217;m too sick to stand), this half
hour. Down wid ye now below stairs
with the rest, where I can keep an eye
on ye. Come down, I say!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>IX.&mdash;Obeying Orders.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Down below!&#8221; the words struck
harshly on Dan&#8217;s ear for good old
Brother Bart was more used to
obedience than command, and he was
sick and shaken and doing his guardian
duty under sore stress and strain to-night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go below! What for?&#8221; asked Dan,
shortly. &#8220;I&#8217;m all right up here, Brother
Bart. I can&#8217;t stand being packed in
downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand it or not, I&#8217;ll not have ye up
here,&#8221; said Brother Bart, resolutely.
&#8220;Down with ye, Dan Dolan! Ye were
put under my orders, and ye&#8217;ll have to
mind my words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when it means being sick as a
dog all night,&#8221; answered Dan, rebelliously.
&#8220;I tell you I can&#8217;t stand it
down in that stuffy place below, and
I won&#8217;t, I am going to stay up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And is that the way ye talk?&#8221; said
Brother Bart, who had a spirit of his
own. &#8220;And it&#8217;s only what I might look
for, ye graceless young reprobate! God
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
knows it was sore against my will that
I brought ye with me, Dan Dolan; for
I knew ye&#8217;d be a sore trial first to last.
But I had to obey them that are above
me. Stay, then, if you will against my
word; for it&#8217;s all I have to hold ye,
since ye are beyant any rule or law.&mdash;We&#8217;ll
go back, my man,&#8221; continued
Brother Bart to the burly deck hand
who had been supporting his swaying
form. &#8220;Help me to get down to my
bed, in God&#8217;s name; for I am that sick
I can scarcely see.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Brother Bart tottered away,
leaving Dan standing hot and defiant by
his new friend, Mr. Wirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to have made trouble for
you,&#8221; said that gentleman; &#8220;but when
I found that good old man wandering
sick and distracted over the boat, stirring
up everyone in search of a lost
boy, there was nothing to do but give
him the tip.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Freddy may stand it,&#8221; said Dan,
fiercely; &#8220;but I won&#8217;t be grannied.
What harm is there in staying up
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None at all from our standpoint,&#8221;
was the reply; &#8220;but the good old gentleman
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
looks at things in another light.
You&#8217;re under his orders,&#8221; he said; and
there was a faint, mocking note in the
words, that Dan was keen enough to
hear. He was hearing other things
too,&mdash;the pant of the engines, the throb
of the pulsing mechanism that was
bearing him on through darkness lit
only by the radiance of those sweeping
worlds above; but that mocking note
in his new friend&#8217;s voice rose over all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Orders!&#8221; he repeated angrily. &#8220;I
bet <i>you</i> wouldn&#8217;t take any such orders
if you were a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I wouldn&#8217;t, and I didn&#8217;t&#8221; (there
was a slight change in the speaker&#8217;s
voice as he paused to light a cigar),
&#8220;and you see where it left me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; asked Dan, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adrift,&#8221; was the answer,&mdash;&#8220;like
this big boat would be if there was no
one to command: beyond rule and law,
as that good old friend of yours said
just now,&mdash;beyond rule and law.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beyond rule and law,&mdash;rule and
law.&#8221; The words began to hammer
somehow on Dan&#8217;s head and heart as
he recalled with waking remorse poor
Brother Bart tottering away in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
darkness,&mdash;Brother Bart, who, as Dan
knew, was only doing his duty faithfully,
to the boy under his care,&mdash;Brother
Bart, who, like the steamboat,
like the stars, was <i>obeying</i>.</p>
<p>For a moment or two Mr. Wirt
puffed at his cigar silently, while the
fierce fire that had blazed up in Dan&#8217;s
breast sank into bounds, mastered by
the boy&#8217;s better self, even as he had
seen Nature&#8217;s fierce forces of flame and
steam mastered by higher powers
to-day.</p>
<p>&#8220;In short,&#8221; said Mr. Wirt at last, as
if he had been having thoughts of his
own, &#8220;I am a derelict, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Dan, who had
never heard the word before.</p>
<p>&#8220;A ship adrift, abandoned by captain
and crew,&mdash;a wreck that tosses on the
sea, a peril to all that come near it.
There is nothing a good sailor dreads
more than a derelict, and he makes it
his business to sink it promptly whenever
he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t he tow it into port?&#8221; asked
Dan, with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not worth the trouble,&#8221; was the
grim answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;I&#8217;d try it, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you?&#8221; asked Mr. Wirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Dan, decidedly. &#8220;If a
ship can float, it must be worth something.
I&#8217;d try to fling a hawser about
it somewhere, and haul it in and dry-dock
it to find out what was wrong.
I&#8217;ve seen an oyster boat, that was leaking
at every seam, calked and patched
and painted to be good as new.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; said Mr. Wirt, with a
short laugh; &#8220;but the oyster boats
don&#8217;t go very far a-sea, and derelicts
drift beyond hope or help. I am that
kind, and if&mdash;if&#8221; (the speaker hesitated
for a moment),&mdash;&#8220;if I had a boy like
you, I wouldn&#8217;t take any chances with
him: I&#8217;d keep him off my deck; I&#8217;d
put him on a sound ship with a wise
captain and a steady crew, and he
should be under orders until&mdash;well,
until he had learned to sail midnight
seas like this by the light of the stars.&#8221;
And, tossing his half-smoked cigar into
the water, Mr. Wirt turned abruptly
away without any further &#8220;goodnight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a queer one,&#8221; said Dan to himself,
as he stared after the tall figure
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
disappearing in the darkness. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know what he means by his drifting
and derelicts, but I guess it&#8217;s a sort of
talk about breaking laws and rules like
I am doing here to-night. Gee! but
Brother Bart is an old granny; stirring
up all this fuss about nothing; and I&#8217;ll
be dead sick, I know. But I&#8217;m under
orders&#8221; (Dan stretched his arms over
his head, and, drawing a long, reluctant
sigh, took a last look at the stars),
&#8220;and I guess I&#8217;ll have to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he went, making his way with
some difficulty over the swaying decks
and down deep stairs where the footing
was more perilous than the heights
of Old Top; through long stretches of
gorgeous saloons whence all the life
and gayety had departed; for, despite
the stars, the sea was rough to-night,
and old Neptune under a friendly smile
was doing his worst.</p>
<p>Jim and Dud, sturdy fellows that
they were, had somewhat recovered
their equilibrium and were dozing fitfully;
but little Freddy was still white
and wretched; and poor Brother Bart,
all the ruddy glow gone from his face,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
lay with his hands clasping his Rosary,
very sick indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say your prayers as well as ye can,
laddie,&#8221; he moaned to that small sufferer.
&#8220;The Lord be merciful to us
both if we&#8217;re not to see the morning
light!&mdash;Ah, are ye back, Dan Dolan?&#8221;
as his eyes fell upon the wandering
sheep of his flock standing beside him.
&#8220;May God forgive ye for this night&#8217;s
work! It was the looking for ye that
killed me entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Brother Bart, no, you&#8217;re not as
bad as that!&#8221; said Dan, remorsefully;
&#8220;but I&#8217;m down here now to take care of
you and Freddy, and you see if I don&#8217;t
do it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan, who in the old days of
Tabby and the blue teapot had watched
with and waited on Aunt Winnie
through many a night of pain, proved
as good as his word. It was as close
and hot and stuffy as he had foreseen;
the big boat plunged and rolled so that
it was hard to keep his footing; at
times he himself grew so sick that he
could scarcely steady his helping hand,
but he never gave up his job. He
bathed poor Brother Bart&#8217;s aching head
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
with all a woman&#8217;s tenderness; bandaged
Freddy&#8217;s throbbing temples with
the cold compress that sent him off to
sleep; made dizzy forays into unknown
domestic departments for cracked ice
and soda water; shocked Brother Bart
out of what he believed his last agony
by reporting everyone on the boat in
&#8220;the same fix.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in smooth water, the men
say, by morning; and then you&#8217;ll be all
right, Brother Bart. Let me bathe
your head some more, and try to go to
sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>And when at last Brother Bart did
fall asleep in the grey glimmer of the
early dawn, it was a very pale, shaking,
dizzy Dan that crept out on the open
deck beyond the staterooms for a
breath of fresh air. He could not have
climbed to forbidden heights now even
if he would. But they were in smooth
waters, and the boat was pushing onto
a sandy point, where a branch railroad
came down to the shore. A dozen or
more passengers were preparing to
land; among them was Mr. Wirt, with
a gun slung to his shoulder, a knapsack
on his back, and his two great
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
tawny dogs pulling in their leashes impatiently,&mdash;all
evidently ready for a
summer in the wilds.</p>
<p>Dan felt too weak and sick for conversation
until Mr. Wirt&#8217;s eye fell upon
the pale, trembling boy, who, with head
bared to the morning breeze, was clinging
weakly to an awning post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, hello, my lad!&#8221; said the gentleman.
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter. I
thought you were all right when I saw
you last up above.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; answered Dan, grimly.
&#8220;But I came down, and, jing! I&#8217;ve had
a night of it, with Brother Bart and
Freddy both dead sick on my hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you nursed them all night?&#8221;
(There was an odd tremor in the
speaker&#8217;s voice.) &#8220;Are they better this
morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;They are all
right now, sleeping like tops; but they
had a tough time. It was lucky I gave
up and came down to look after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you obeyed orders, after all.
And now you&#8217;re all broken up yourself?&#8221;
said the gentleman, compassionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, no!&#8221; was the sturdy answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
&#8220;I don&#8217;t break up so easily. I&#8217;ll be all
right, too, in a little while,&mdash;after I&#8217;ve
had more of this fresh air. Going to
get off here?&mdash;&#8221; as the boat pushed up
to the wharf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Wirt. &#8220;I&#8217;m off to the
woods for a few weeks; but&mdash;but
maybe you will see me again later.
Meanwhile what did the little fellow
call you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan,&mdash;my name is Dan Dolan,&#8221; was
the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then good-bye, Dan!&#8221; Mr. Wirt&#8217;s
shapely hand closed over the boy&#8217;s in
a strong pressure. &#8220;You&#8217;ve given me a
lesson, Dan,&mdash;I won&#8217;t forget you.&#8221;
And he was off with his dogs across
the gangway to the shore just flushing
with the morning light.</p>
<p>The worst was over; and Dan, worn
out with his night of watching, was
glad to creep into his &#8220;packing box&#8221; of
a stateroom, and, flinging himself in
his berth, dropped off to sleep,&mdash;a sleep
full of strange dreams. They were wild
and troubled dreams at first. He was
down in black depths where, stripped
to the waist, he was working amid
roaring fires and hissing steam; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
was out on a dark wide ocean, striving
to fling a rope to a wreck drifting
helplessly amid thundering breakers;
he was up on a wind-swept deck, with
Brother Bart&#8217;s shaking grasp dragging
him down below. Then suddenly the
picture changed: it was not Brother
Bart but old Father Mack whose trembling
hand was upon his arm, guiding
him through the leafy shadows of the
college walk where they had last talked
together. Beyond and above them was
the dazzling glory of the stars, those
sweeping worlds on which the young
dreamer had looked last night. But as
he walked on now, the leafy shadows
seemed to grow into arched and pillared
aisles rising far, far above him, and
the stars were but the countless tapers
on a mighty altar reaching to heights
he could not see; and Aunt Winnie,
was kneeling on the steps,&mdash;old Aunt
Winnie, with clasped hands and uplifted
eyes. Then the guiding hand seemed to
tighten on his arm, and it was Brother
Bart again beside him,&mdash;Brother Bart,
his sturdy, ruddy self again, shaking
him awake.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hate to rouse ye, Danny lad&#8221;
(there was a new friendliness in the old
man&#8217;s tone), &#8220;for it was the long, hard
night ye had with us; but we&#8217;re to get
off here. Praise be to God, our killing
journey is nearly done!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan stumbled out hurriedly to
the deck, to find the boat pushing into
the harbor of a quaint old town, whose
roofs and spires were glittering in the
noonday sunshine. Pretty sailboats
were flitting hither and thither on
sunny wings; the white stretch of
beach was gay with bathers; the full
notes of an orchestra came from the
band stand on the jutting pier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; exclaimed Dan, in amazement
at such a festive scene. &#8220;Is this
Killykinick?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was Dud Fielding&#8217;s surly
answer. &#8220;I wish it was. But I mean
to cut over here to the Fosters whenever
I can. This is Beach Cliff, where
we have to take a sailboat to Killykinick.
And,&#8221; Dud went on, with
deepening disgust, &#8220;I bet it&#8217;s that old
tub that is signalling to us now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s eyes, following Dud&#8217;s sullen
gaze, saw, among the gaily painted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
pleasure craft moored at the wharfs, a
clumsy little boat with rusty sides and
dingy sail. An old man stood in the
stern waving a tattered flag that,
caught out by the breeze, showed in
large faded letters&mdash;Killykinick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>X.&mdash;On the &#8220;Sary Ann.&#8221;</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the sign,&#8221; said Brother Bart
gratefully, as he caught sight of the
fluttering pennant. &#8220;He was to wave
the flag to us so we would know the
boat. Keep together now, boys,&#8221; continued
their anxious guardian, who
was a little bewildered by a rush and
struggle to which he was not accustomed.
&#8220;Ah, God help them that have
to push their way in a world like this!
Hold to my hand, laddie, or ye&#8217;ll be
tramped down. Straight behind me
now, the rest of ye, so ye won&#8217;t be lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, marshalling his boyish force,
Brother Bart pressed on through the
hurrying throngs that surged over
gangway (for it was the height of the
holiday season) until he reached the
shabby little boat whose occupant was
a very old man with a face brown and
wrinkled as tanned leather. A long
scar across his cheek had twisted his
mouth into a crooked smile. He spat
a large quid of tobacco into the water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
and greeted his passengers with an old
sea dog&#8217;s growl:</p>
<p>&#8220;Been waitin&#8217; more than an hour for
ye, but that consarned boat ain&#8217;t never
on time! Hit some pretty rough
weather, I reckon, out at sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; answered Brother Bart,
with feeling. &#8220;It&#8217;s the mercy of God
we&#8217;re alive to tell the tale. In with ye,
boys, and sit steady. Take the middle
of the boat, laddie, and hold to Dan.
Give me a hand to help me in; for I&#8217;m
weak and shaking yet. The Lord&#8217;s will
be done, but I never thought to be sailing
the seas in a cockleshell like this,&#8221;
added the good man, as the boat rocked
under his sturdy weight when he sank
heavily into his place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say so, too. Let&#8217;s hire something
better,&#8221; replied Dud Fielding, eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar ain&#8217;t nothing better or safer
than this here &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217; along the
shore,&#8221; said the boat&#8217;s master, grimly.
&#8220;I sot every timber in her myself. She
ain&#8217;t got a crack or a creak in her. I
keeled her and calked her, and I&#8217;ll lay
her agin any of them painted and
gilded play-toys to weather the toughest
gale on this here coast. You&#8217;re as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
safe in the &#8216;Sary Ann,&#8217; Padre, as if
you were in church saying your
prayers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no Padre,&#8221; disclaimed Brother
Bart, hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;m only an humble
lay-brother, my good man, that has
come to take care of these boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brother or Father, it&#8217;s all the same
to me,&#8221; was the gruff answer. &#8220;I&#8217;m a
hardshell Baptist myself, but I&#8217;ve only
good feelings to your kind. My old
captain was one of you, and never a
better man walked the deck. Now,
duck, my lads, while I swing out the
sail and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The passengers ducked their heads
hurriedly while the &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217;s&#8217; boom
swung around. Her tawny sail caught
the wind, and she was off with a light,
swift grace that her looks belied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly, she can clip it!&#8221; exclaimed
Jim Norris, who had a home on the
Chesapeake and knew all about a boat.
&#8220;What sort of a rig is she, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mixed like good terbacker,&#8221; briefly
answered the owner, as he leaned back
comfortably at the helm and bit off
another chew. &#8220;Sloop, skiff, outrigger,
lugger,&mdash;she&#8217;s got the good points of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and none of their kicks. Not that she
ain&#8217;t got a spirit of her own. Every
boat worth anything hez. Thar&#8217;s days
when she takes the wind and thar&#8217;s no
holdin&#8217; her. You jest have to let her
spread her wings to it and go. But,
Lord, let that same wind begin to growl
and mutter, let them waves begin to
cap and swell, and the &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217; is
ready for them, you bet. She will drop
all her fun and frolic, and scud along
brave and bare agin the wildest gale
that ever leashed a coast. And them
young bloods over yon laugh at her,&#8221;
continued the &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217;s&#8217; owner,
glowering at the gay buildings of the
fashionable &#8220;boat club&#8221; they were just
now passing. &#8220;They call her the Corsair,&#8217;
which is no Christian name to
give an honest boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Brother Bart:
&#8220;And, though you haven&#8217;t the true
faith, you seem to be a Christian yourself.
What is your name, my good
man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jeroboam Jimson,&#8221; was the answer.
&#8220;Leastways that was what I was christened,
my mother going in heavy for
Scripture names. I had a twin brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
Nebuchanezzar. Sort of mouth-filling
for general use, so we was naturally
shortened down to Neb and Jeb. Most
folks call me Jeb yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It comes easier,&#8221; said Brother Bart;
&#8220;though I&#8217;d never think of giving it to
a man of your years. It seems a pity,
with the Litany of the Saints convenient,
to have to go back so far for
a name. But that is no fault of yours,
as God knows. Have you been living
long in this place we are going to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More than five and forty years,&#8221;
was the answer,&mdash;&#8220;since the &#8216;Lady
Jane&#8217; struck the rocks off Killykinick,
November 27, 1865. I was second
mate to old Captain Kane; and I stood
by him until last May, when he took
the cruise that every man has to make
by himself. And I&#8217;m standing by his
ship &#8217;cording to orders yet. &#8216;Blood is
thicker than water, mate,&#8217; he says to
me; &#8216;I&#8217;ve got to leave all that I have
to little Polly Raynor&#8217;s boy, but you&#8217;re
to stick to the ship as long as you live.
I&#8217;ve hed that put down in the log with
my name to it, and priest and lawyer
and doctor as witness. You&#8217;re Captain
Jeroboam Jimson of the &#8220;Lady
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
Jane,&#8221; in my place, and thar ain&#8217;t no
land sharks nor water sharks can
bother ye.&#8217; I lay that&#8217;s the chap he
called Polly&#8217;s boy,&#8221; said Captain Jeb,
turning his eyes on Freddy, who, seated
at Brother Bart&#8217;s side, had been listening,
with flattering interest, to the old
sailor&#8217;s conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he spoke up eagerly, &#8220;my
mother was Polly. Did you know
her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Captain Jeb, nodding.
&#8220;She came down here once as a bit of
a girl, dancing over the sands like a
water kelpie. The old Captain didn&#8217;t
care much for women folks, but he was
sot on her sure. Then she come down
agin as a bride, purty and shy and
sweet; but the old man warn&#8217;t so
pleased then,&mdash;growled he didn&#8217;t know
what girls wanted to get married for,
nohow. So you&#8217;re her boy!&#8221; The old
man&#8217;s eyes softened as they rested on
Freddy. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got a sort of look of
her, though you ain&#8217;t as pretty,&mdash;not
nigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the &#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221; her
tawny sail swelling in the wind, had
left the gay beach and bathers and boat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
club of Beach Cliff, and was making the
swell of the waves like a sea bird on
the wing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy now, lass!&#8221; cautioned Captain
Jeb, as they neared a white line of
breakers, and he stood up firm and
strong at the helm. &#8220;Steady, all of you
younkers; for we&#8217;re crossing the bar.
Many a good ship has left her bones on
this same reef. Easy, &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217;! It&#8217;s
no place for fooling round here.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as if to emphasize his words,
the black shadows of a wrecked ship
rose gaunt and grim before them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Struck the reef two months ago,&#8221;
explained the Captain, with eye and
hand still steady on his helm. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
get her off. Captain fool enough to
try Beach Cliff Harbor without a native
pilot! Why, thar ain&#8217;t no books nor
charts can tell you nothing &#8217;bout navigating
round these here islands: you
have to larn it yourself. It&#8217;s the deceivingest
stretch along the whole
Atlantic coast. Thar&#8217;s times when this
here bar, that is biling deep with water
now, is bare enough for one of you
chaps to walk across without wetting
your knees. Easy now, &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217;!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
Ketch hold of that rope, younker, and
steady the sail a bit. So thar, we&#8217;re
over the shoals. Now clip it, my lass&#8221;
(and the old man swung the sail
free),&mdash;&#8220;clip it fast as you like for
Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, almost as if she could hear the
&#8220;Sary Ann&#8221; leaped forward with the
bulging sail, and was off at the word;
while Captain Jeb, the harbor reef
safely passed, leaned back in his boat
and pointed out to his young passengers
(for even the elegant Dud was roused
into eager curiosity) the various things
of interest on their way: the light ship,
the lighthouses, the fishing fleet stretching
dim and hazy on the far horizon,
the great ocean liner only a faint
shadow trailing a cloud of smoke in
the blue distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Them big fellows give us the go by
now, though time was when they used
to come from far and near; all kinds&mdash;Spanish,
Portugee, East Indian. Them
was the whaling days, when Beach Cliff
was one of the greatest places on the
coast. She stands out so far she hed the
first bite at things. All the sailing
ships made for snug harbor here. But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
betwixt the steamboats and the railroads
gobbling up everything, and the
earth itself taking to spouting oil,
things are pretty dead and gone here
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But lots of fine folks come in the
summer time,&#8221; said Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s a church!&#8221; exclaimed
Brother Bart, who had caught a passing
glimpse of a cross-crowned spire.
&#8220;Thank God we&#8217;ll not be beyond the
light and truth entirely! You&#8217;re to
take us to Mass every Sunday, my good
man; and we are to give you a dollar
for the trouble of it, to say nothing of
the blessing upon your own soul. Were
you ever at Mass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never,&#8221; answered Captain Jeb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, God help you, poor man!&#8221; said
Brother Bart. &#8220;Sure we never know
our own blessings till we talk with them
that&#8217;s left in the darkness. But it&#8217;s
not too late for the grace of Heaven to
reach you yet. Never been to Mass!
Well, well, well!&#8221; Brother Bart shook
his head, and, as if unable to cope with
such hopeless religious dearth, relapsed
into silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is it much further to Killykinick?&#8221;
asked Dan, who, with shining eyes had
been taking in all this novel experience.
&#8220;Looks like we&#8217;re heading out to nowhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221; with the wind full
in her sail, seemed bearing off into sunlit
distance, where sky and sea met.
There was a faint, shadowy line to the
left; and just beyond, a dim pencil
point pierced the cloudless blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a lighthouse, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked
Jim, who had a sailor&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; growled Captain Jeb, his
leathery face darkening. &#8220;Why they
wanted to set up that consarned thing
just across from Killykinick, I don&#8217;t
know. Hedn&#8217;t we been showing a light
thar for nigh onto fifty years? But
some of these know-alls come along and
said it wasn&#8217;t the right kind; it
oughter blink. And they made the old
captain pull down the light that he had
been burning steady and true, and the
Government sot up that thar newfangled
thing a flashing by clockwork
on Numbskull Nob. It did make the old
man hot, sure. &#8216;Shet the window,
mate,&#8217; he said to me when he was dying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
and wanted air badly. &#8216;I can&#8217;t go off in
peace with that devilish thing of Numbskull
Nob a winking at me.&#8217; Duck
Agin, all hands! &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217; swings
around here. Thar&#8217;s Killykinick to
starboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>And all hands &#8220;ducked&#8221; as rope and
canvas rattled under Captain Jeb&#8217;s
guiding hand; and the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221;
swept from her dancing course to the
boundless blue towards the shadowy
line and dim pencil point now growing
into graceful lighthouse and rocky
shore. Numbskull Nob, jutting up from
a hidden reef, over which a line of
white-capped breakers was booming
thunderously, seemed to justify the
presence of the modern light that
warned off closer approach to the
island; for the stretch of water that
lay between was a treacherous shoal
where many a good ship had stranded
in years gone by, when Killykinick was
only a jagged ledge of rock where the
sea birds nested and man had no place.
But things had changed now. A rude
but sturdy breakwater made a miniature
harbor in which several small
boats floated at their moorings; a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
whitewashed wharf jutted out into the
waves; the stretch of rocky shore beyond
had been roughly terraced into
easy approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy now, boys,&mdash;easy!&#8221; warned
Brother Bart anxiously, as the &#8220;Sary
Ann&#8221; grated against her home pier, and
Captain Jeroboam proceeded to make
fast. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be leaping off till you
know the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Brother Bart might have called
to the dashing waves. This Killykinick
was very different from the desert they
had expected; and, with shouts of delight
from Jim, Dud and Dan, even little
Freddy sprang ashore. Shrubs and
trees of strange growth nodded and
waved amid the rocks; here and there
in sheltered crannies were beds of
blooming flowers; and in the lee of a
towering rock that kept off the fury
of storm and wind stood the very queerest
house the young explorers had ever
seen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XI.&mdash;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>At Killykinick.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was a ship,&mdash;a ship with its keel
settled deep in the sand, and held immovable
against wind and storm by a
rudely built foundation wall of broken
rock. The sunlight blinked cheerfully
from the dozen portholes; the jutting
prow bore the weather-worn figurehead
of the &#8220;Lady Jane,&#8221;&mdash;minus a nose and
arm, it is true, but holding her post
bravely still. Stout canvas, that could
be pegged down or lifted into breezy
shelter, roofed the deck, from which
arose the &#8220;lookout,&#8221; a sort of light
tower built around a mast that upheld
a big ship lantern; while the Stars and
Stripes floated in glory over all.</p>
<p>For a moment the four young travellers
stared breathless at this remarkable
edifice, while Freddy eagerly
explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s ship that
was wrecked here on Killykinick. He
had sailed in her for years and loved
her, and he didn&#8217;t want to leave her
to fall to pieces on the rocks; and so he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
got a lot of men, with chains and ropes
and things, and moved her up here and
made her into a house.&#8221;</p>
<p>And a first-class house the &#8220;Lady
Jane&#8221; made, as all the boys agreed
when they proceeded to investigate
Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s legacy. True, there
was a lack of modern conveniences.
The sea lapping the sands to the right
was the only bath-room, but what finer
one could a boy ask? There was
neither dining room nor kitchen; only
the &#8220;galley,&#8221; as Captain Jeb, who came
up shortly to do the honors of this
establishment, explained to his guests.
The &#8220;galley&#8221; was a queer little narrow
place in the stern, lined with pots and
pans and dishes scoured to a shine, and
presided over by another old man more
crooked and leathery-visaged than
Captain Jeb, and who seemed too deep
in the concoction of some savory mixture
simmering on his charcoal stove
to give look or word to the newcomers
who crowded around him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Neb,&#8221; said his brother, in
brief introduction. &#8220;He don&#8217;t hev
much to say, but you mustn&#8217;t mind
that. It ain&#8217;t been altogether clear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
weather in his upper deck since he
shipped with a durned pirate of a captain
that laid his head open with a
marline spike; but for a cook, he can&#8217;t
be beat by any steward afloat or ashore.
Jest you wait till he doses out that
clam-chowder he&#8217;s making now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the long, low cabin
that stretched the full length of the
&#8220;Lady Jane,&#8221; and that&mdash;with its four
cosy bunks made up shipshape, its big
table, its swinging lamp, its soft bulging
chairs (for Great-uncle Joe had
been a man of solid weight as well as
worth)&mdash;was just the place for boys to
disport themselves in without fear of
doing damage. All about were most
interesting things for curious young
eyes to see and busy fingers to handle:
telescope, compass, speaking trumpet,
log and lead and line that had done
duty in many a distant sea; spears,
bows and arrowheads traded for on
savage islands; Chinese ivories and
lacquered boxes from Japan. A white
bearskin and walrus tusk told of an
early venture into the frozen North,
when bold men were first drawn to its
darkness and mystery; while the Buddha
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
from an Eastern temple, squatting
shut-eyed on a shelf, roused good old
Brother Bart into holy horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never thought to be under the
same roof with a haythen idol. Put it
away, my man,&mdash;put it out of sight
while I&#8217;m in yer house; for I can&#8217;t
stand the looks of it. I&#8217;ll be after
smashing it into bits if ye lave it under
me eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And his indignation was appeased
only by the sight of the Captain&#8217;s room,
which had been respectfully assigned to
the &#8220;Padre,&#8221; as Captain Jeb persisted
in calling his older guest.</p>
<p>Here Great-uncle Joe had treasures
rare indeed in the good Brother&#8217;s eye:
a wonderful crucifix of ivory and
ebony; the silver altar lamp of an old
Spanish monastery; a Madonna in dull
tints that still bore traces of a master
hand; a rosary, whose well-worn beads
made Brother Bart&#8217;s pious heart warm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed he was a God-fearing man,
I&#8217;m sure, this uncle of laddie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was,&#8221; agreed Captain Jeb; &#8220;a
little rough-talking sometimes, but all
sailors are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a rough life,&#8221; said Brother
Bart, recalling his own late experience.
&#8220;It&#8217;s little chance it gives you to think
or pray. But the old man ye talk of
prayed; I am sure of that. The beads
here bear token of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; answered Captain Jeb. &#8220;He
held to them to the last as tight as if
they was an anchor chain,&mdash;why I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s yer ignorance, poor man!&#8221;
said Brother Bart, compassionately.
&#8220;Ye should pray morning and evening
for light, and perhaps ye&#8217;ll be given the
grace to know what the hould of blessed
beads is to a dying hand. Now, if ye
don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;ll rest a bit in this quiet
place, and try to say me own prayers
that I missed last night; for it was a
sore trying time to me, both body and
soul. There&#8217;s no harm can come to the
boys, now that they are safe here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t swear to four younkers
like them anywhere,&#8221; was the grim
answer. &#8220;But ye can rest easy, Padre:
I&#8217;ll keep an eye on them, never fear.&#8221;
And, closing the old Captain&#8217;s door on
his anxious guest, Captain Jeb proceeded
to &#8220;keep an eye&#8221; on the boys
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
who were exploring Killykinick in every
direction.</p>
<p>As it had little more than half a mile
of visible surface, the exploration was
naturally limited; but there was a &#8220;deal
more below,&#8221; as Captain Jeb assured
them,&mdash;reefs and shoals stretching out
in every direction, and widening every
year with the silt carried down from
the shore. There were one or two wide
hollows between the rocks, where that
same silt, top-dressed with richer earth
imported from more favored spots by
Captain Jeb, served as kitchen garden,
in which beans, cabbages and potatoes
made a promising show. On another
sheltered slope, green with coarse grass,
brown Betty was pasturing peacefully;
while in a henhouse beyond there was
clucking and cackling, cheerfully suggestive
of chickens and eggs.</p>
<p>&#8220;We used to hev mostly ship rations,&#8221;
said Captain Jeb. &#8220;But the old man got
sort of picky and choosy these last
years, and turned agin the hard-tack
and old hoss meat that had been good
enough for him before. So I got a few
boat-loads of good earth and took to
growing things. And things do grow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
here for sure, if you only give them a
chance. All they want is root hold; the
sun and the air and the soft mists do
the rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there was the pump house; for
even the toughest of old &#8220;salts&#8221; must
have fresh water. And it had cost many
a dollar to strike it in these rocks; but
strike it at last the well-borers did, and
the pump was roofed and walled in as
Killykinick&#8217;s greatest treasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stick round here, younkers, along by
the &#8216;Lady Jane&#8217; and the wharf and the
garden beds, and down by the &#8216;Sary
Ann&#8217; and the boats to the south beach,
and you&#8217;ll be pretty safe. But I&#8217;m going
to show you a place whar you can&#8217;t do
no monkey shining, for it ain&#8217;t safe at
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as Captain Jeb spoke he turned
to the high wall of rock that had backed
and sheltered the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8221; for
nearly fifty years; and, bending his thin
form, he pushed through a low, narrow
opening, with, it is needless to say, four
wide-eyed boys scrambling breathlessly
behind him,&mdash;Dan, as usual, in the lead,
pulling Freddy on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>For a moment they stumbled in darkness,
through which came a thunderous
sound like the swell of some mighty
organ under a master hand; and then
they were out in light and space again,
with the ocean cliff of Killykinick arching
above and around them in a great
cave hollowed by the beating waves out
of solid rock. Wall and roof were rough
and jagged, broken into points and
ledges; but the floor was smoothed by
the tide into a shining, glittering surface,
that widened out to meet the line
of breakers thundering white-foamed
beyond, their sprays scattering in light
showers far and near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing! Golly! Hooray!&#8221; burst from
the young explorers; and they would
have dashed off into bolder investigation
of this new discovery, but Captain
Jeb&#8217;s sudden trumpet tone withheld
them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop,&mdash;stop thar, younkers! Didn&#8217;t
I tell you this warn&#8217;t no play-place?
How far and how deep these caves
stretch only the Lord knows; for the
sea is knawing them deeper and wider
every year. And thar&#8217;s holes and quicksands
that would suck you down quicker
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
than that whale in the Good Book swallowed
Jonah. And more than that: in
three hours from now these here rocks
whar we are standing will be biling
with high tide. This ain&#8217;t no play-place!
I&#8217;m showing it to you so you&#8217;ll
know; for thar ain&#8217;t no reefs and shoals
to easy things here. It&#8217;s deep sea
soundings that no line can reach, this
nor&#8217;east shore. Them waves hev a clean
sweep of three thousand miles before
they break here. And thar ain&#8217;t to be
no ducking nor swimming nor monkey
shining around here unless me or Neb
is on watch. Neb ain&#8217;t much good for
navigating since he got that hit with
the marline spike, but for a watch on
ship or shore he is all right. So them
&#8216;orders&#8217; is all I hev to give: the Padre,
being a bit nervous, may hev some of
his own; but thar ain&#8217;t nothing to hurt
four strapping younkers round Killykinick
except right <i>here</i>. And now, I
reckon, it&#8217;s about time for dinner. I&#8217;m
ready for some of Neb&#8217;s clam-chowder,
I know; and I guess you are, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing! but this is a great place of
yours, Freddy!&#8221; said Dan, as they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
turned back to the ship house. &#8220;We
could not have found a better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all you know,&#8221; scoffed the
lordly Dud. &#8220;I mean to keep on the
right side of the old duffer,&#8221; he added
<i>sotto voce</i>, &#8220;and get over to Beach Cliff
in that tub of his whenever I can.
Minnie Foster asked me to come;
they&#8217;ve taken a fine house down on the
shore, and have all sorts of fun&mdash;dances,
picnics, boat races. I&#8217;ll get sick
of things here pretty soon; won&#8217;t you,
Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; was the
lazy answer. &#8220;About as good a place to
loaf as you&#8217;ll find.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Loaf?&#8221; put in Dan. &#8220;There isn&#8217;t
going to be any loafing at Killykinick
for me. I&#8217;m for boating and fishing
and clamming and digging up those
garden beds. I don&#8217;t know what those
others are paying,&#8221; said Dan, who had
fallen behind with Captain Jeb; &#8220;but
I&#8217;ve got no money, and am ready to
earn my board and keep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are?&#8221; said the Captain, in surprise.
&#8220;As I took it, the Padre bunched
you all together for as fair a figure as I
could ask.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not me,&#8221; replied Dan. &#8220;These other
chaps are plutes, and can pay their own
way; so cut me out of your figures and
let me work for myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s sort of curious talk for
a younker with a high-class schooling,&#8221;
said Captain Jeb, dubiously. &#8220;You
mean you want to hire out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dan, remembering Aunt
Winnie and how doubtful his claim was
upon St. Andrew&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar will be considerable stirring
round, I&#8217;ll allow,&#8221; was the reflective
answer. &#8220;I was thinking of getting
Billy Benson to lend a hand, but if you&#8217;d
like the job of sort of second mate&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;What is a
second mate&#8217;s work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Obeying orders,&#8221; answered Captain
Jeb, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s dead easy,&#8221; said Dan, with a
grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it?&#8221; was the grim rejoinder.
&#8220;Jest you wait, younker, till you&#8217;ve stood
on a toppling deck in the teeth of a nor&#8217;easter,
with some dunderhead of a captain
roaring cuss words at you to cut
away the mast that you know is all
that&#8217;s keeping you out of Davy Jones&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
Locker, and then you&#8217;ll find what obeying
orders means. But if you want the
job here, it&#8217;s yours. What will you
take?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My board and keep,&#8221; answered Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t no sort of pay,&#8221; said the
other, gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see me eat,&#8221; laughed
Dan; &#8220;besides, I was never a second
mate before. Maybe I won&#8217;t make good
at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Captain Jeb,
his mouth stretching into its crooked
smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re ruther young for it, I
must admit. Still, I like your grit and
pluck, younker. Most chaps like you are
ready to suck at anything in reach.
What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan&mdash;Dan Dolan,&#8221; was the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Captain Jeb. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
square, honest name. You&#8217;re shipped,
Dan Dolan. I guess thar ain&#8217;t no need
for signing papers. This little chap
will bear witness. You&#8217;re shipped as
second mate in the &#8216;Lady Jane&#8217; now and
here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XII.&mdash;The Second Mate.&mdash;A Confab.</p>
</div>

<p>Then Neb&#8217;s bell clanged out for dinner,
that was served on the long table in the
cabin, shipshape, but without any of the
frills used on land. There was a deep
earthen dish brimming with chowder, a
wonderful concoction that only old salts
like Neb can make. It had a bit of
everything within Killykinick reach&mdash;clams
and fish and pork and potatoes,
onions and peppers and hard-tack,&mdash;all
simmering together, piping hot, in a
most appetizing way, even though it
had to be &#8220;doused&#8221; out with a tin ladle
into yellow bowls. There was plenty of
good bread, thick and &#8220;filling&#8221;; a platter
of bacon and greens, and a dish of
rice curried after a fashion Neb had
learned cruising in the China Sea. Last
of all, and borne in triumphantly by the
cook himself, was a big smoking &#8220;plum
duff&#8221; with cream sauce. There is a base
imitation of &#8220;duff&#8221; known to landsmen
as batter pudding; but the real plum
duff of shining golden yellow, stuffed
full of plums like Jack Horner&#8217;s pie, is
all the sailor&#8217;s own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Dan plunged at once into his new
duties of second mate. Both Jeb and
Neb were well past seventy, and, while
still hale and hearty, were not so nimble
as they had been forty years ago; so a
second mate, with light feet and deft
hands, proved most helpful, now that
the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8221; had taken in a double
crew.</p>
<p>Dan cleared the table and washed the
dishes with a celerity bewildering to the
slow brain dulled by the marline spike.
He swabbed up the galley under Neb&#8217;s
gruff direction; he fed the chickens and
milked the cow. For a brief space in
two summers of his early life, Dan had
been borne off by an Angel Guardian
Society to its Fresh Air Home, a plain,
old-fashioned farmhouse some miles
from his native city; and, being a keen-eyed
youngster even then, he had left
swings and seesaws to less interested
observers, and trudged around the
fields, the henhouse, the dairies, the
barns, watching the digging and the
planting, the feeding and the milking;
so that the ways of cows and chickens
were not altogether beyond his ken.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure and yer board and keep was to
be paid for with the rest, lad,&#8221; said
Brother Bart, kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want it paid, Brother,&#8221; replied
Dan. &#8220;St. Andrew&#8217;s does enough
for me. I&#8217;d a heap rather work for myself
out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether that is decent spirit or
sinful pride I&#8217;m not scholar enough to
tell,&#8221; said the good Brother in perplexity.
&#8220;It takes a wise man sometimes to
know the differ; but I&#8217;m thinking&#8221; (and
there was a friendly gleam in the old
man&#8217;s eyes) &#8220;if I was a strapping lad
like you, I would feel the same. So
work your own way if you will, Danny
lad, and God bless you at it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even heartier was the well-wishing
of Captain Jeb after his first day&#8217;s experience
with his second officer.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, matie!&#8221; he said,
slapping Dan-on the shoulder. &#8220;There
will be no loafing on your watch, I kin
see. You&#8217;re the clipper build I like.
Them others ain&#8217;t made to stand rough
weather; but as I take it, you&#8217;re a sort
of Mother Carey chicken that&#8217;s been
nested in the storm. And I don&#8217;t think
you&#8217;ll care to be boxed up below with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
them fair-weather chaps. Suppose, being
second mate, you swing a hammock
up on the deck with Jeb and me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing! I&#8217;d like that first rate,&#8221; was
the delighted answer.</p>
<p>And, as Brother Bart had no fear of
danger on the &#8220;Lady Jane,&#8221; Dan entered
on all the privileges of his position.
While Freddy and Dud and Jim
took possession of the sheltered cabin,
and the dignity of the Padre (so it
seemed to Captain Jeb) demanded the
state and privacy of the Captain&#8217;s
room, Dan swung his hammock up on
deck, where it swayed delightfully in
the wind, while the stout awnings close-reefed
in fair weather gave full view
of the sea and the stars.</p>
<p>He slept like a child cradled in its
mother&#8217;s arms, and was up betimes to
plunge into a stretch of sheltered waves,
still rosy with the sunrise, for a morning
bath such as no porcelain tub could
offer; and then to start off with old Neb,
who, like other wise householders, began
the day&#8217;s work early. Neb might
be deaf and dull, and, in boyish parlance,
a trifle &#8220;dippy&#8221;; but he knew the
ways of fish, from whales to minnows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
He had a boat of his own, with its nets
and seines and lines, that not even the
sturdy old Captain in the days of his
command dared touch.</p>
<p>That Dan was allowed to handle the
oars this first morning proved that the
second mate had already established
himself firmly in Neb&#8217;s favor. But, as
Wharf Rat, Dan had gained some
knowledge of boats and oars; and he
was able to do his part under the old
salt&#8217;s gruff direction. They went far
out beyond shoal and reef; beyond
Numskull Nob (whose light was still
blinking faintly in the glow of the sunrise),
into deep waters, where the fishing
fleet could be seen already at work
in the blue distance hauling up big
catches of cod, halibut, and other game.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ain&#8217;t fishing!&#8221; growled old
Neb. &#8220;It&#8217;s durned mean killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t all fishing killing?&#8221; asked
Dan, as they flung out their own lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Neb. &#8220;When you cast a
line, or a harpoon even, you give critters
a chance; but them durned pirates
thar don&#8217;t give a fish no chance at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever cast a harpoon?&#8221; asked
Dan, with interest.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>For a moment the dull eyes kindled,
the dull face brightened, as some deadened
memory seemed to stir and waken
into life; then the shadow fell heavy
and hopeless again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe I did, sonny; I don&#8217;t know.
It&#8217;s so far back I&#8217;ve most forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>But old Neb&#8217;s wits worked in their
own way still. It took less than an
hour to catch dinners for the whole
Killykinick crew; and the fishermen
came home to find that Captain Jeb had
been doing duty during their absence,
and breakfast was ready on the long
table in the cabin,&mdash;a breakfast such as
none of the white-coated waiters in
their late journey could beat.</p>
<p>Captain Jeb knew nothing of cereals,
but he had a big bowl of mush and a
pitcher of golden cream; he had bacon
and eggs frizzled to a charm; he had
corndodgers and coffee that filled the
air with fragrance,&mdash;such coffee as old
sailors look for about break of day after
a middle watch. Altogether, the crew of
the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8221; found things very
pleasant, and the first week at Killykinick
had all the interest of life in a
newly discovered land. Even Brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Bart was argued by the two old salts
out of his &#8220;nervousness,&#8221; and laddie
was allowed to boat and fish and swim
in safe waters under Dan&#8217;s care; while
Jim and Dud looked out for themselves,
as such big fellows should.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar&#8217;s nothing to hurt them off
thar,&#8221; said Captain Jeb, as Brother
Bart watched his navigators with
anxious eyes pushing out over a stretch
of dancing waves. &#8220;&#8217;Twixt here and
Numskull Nob you could &#8217;most walk
ashore. Jest keep them out of the
Devil&#8217;s Jaw, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord between us and harm!&#8221;
ejaculated Brother Bart, in pious horror.
&#8220;Where is that at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The stretch of rock yonder,&#8221; replied
Captain Jeb, nodding to the northeast.</p>
<p>&#8220;And isn&#8217;t that an awful name to
give to a Christian shore?&#8221; asked
Brother Bart.</p>
<p>&#8220;No worse than them ar suck-holes
of waves deserves,&#8221; was the grim
answer. &#8220;When the high tide sweeps
in thar, it kerries everything with it,
and them caves guzzle it all down, nobody
knows whar.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, God save us!&#8221; said Brother
Bart. &#8220;It&#8217;s the quare place to choose
aither for life or death. I wonder at the
laddie&#8217;s uncle, and ye too, for staying
all these years. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better
now, at yer time of life, for ye to be
saving yer soul in quiet and peace, away
from the winds and the storms and the
roaring seas that are beating around ye
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the gruff answer,&mdash;&#8220;no,
Padre. I couldn&#8217;t live away from the
winds and the storms and the waves.
I couldn&#8217;t die away from them either.
I&#8217;d be like a deep sea-fish washed clean
ashore. How them landlubbers live with
everything dead and dull around them,
I don&#8217;t see. I ain&#8217;t been out of sight of
deep water since I shipped as cabin boy
in the &#8216;Lady Jane&#8217; nigh onto sixty
years ago. I&#8217;ve been aloft in her rigging
with the sea beating over the deck
and the wind whistling so loud ye
couldn&#8217;t hear the cuss words the old
man was a-roaring through his trumpet
below. I&#8217;ve held her wheel through
many a black night when no mortal
man could tell shore from sea. I stood
by her when she struck on this here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
reef, ripped open from stem to stern;
and I&#8217;m standing by her now, &#8217;cording
to the old Captain&#8217;s orders, yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye may be right,&#8221; said Brother Bart,
reflectively. &#8220;It&#8217;s not for me to judge
ye, Jeroboam.&#8221; (Brother Bart never
shortened that Scriptural title.) &#8220;But
I bless the Lord day and night that I
was not called to the sea.&mdash;What is it
the boys are after now!&#8221; he added, with
an anxious glance at the boat in which
laddie and Dan had ventured out beyond
his call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lobsters,&#8221; replied Captain Jeb.
&#8220;Them&#8217;s Neb&#8217;s lobster pots bobbing up
thar, and they&#8217;ve got a catch that will
give us a dinner fit for a king.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all to your taste,&#8221; said Brother
Bart. &#8220;Barrin&#8217; fast days, of which I
say nothing, I wouldn&#8217;t give a good
Irish stew for all the fish that ever
swam the seas. But laddie is thrivin&#8217;
on the food here, I must say. There&#8217;s
a red in his cheeks I haven&#8217;t seen for
months; but what with the rocks and
the seas and the Devil&#8217;s Jaw foreninst
them, it will be the mercy of God if I
get the four boys safe home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t fear,&#8221; was the cheering
assurance. &#8220;They are fine, strapping
fellows, and a touch of sailor life won&#8217;t
harm them; though it&#8217;s plain them two
big chaps and little Polly&#8217;s boys are used
to softer quarters. But for a long
voyage I&#8217;d ship Mate Danny before any
of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye would?&#8221; asked Brother Bart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; answered Captain Jeb, decisively.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t fly no false colors, sticks
to his job, ready to take hold of anything
from a lobster pot to a sheet anchor,&mdash;honest
grit straight through.
Lord, what a ship captain he would
make! But they don&#8217;t teach navigation
at your school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Brother
Bart. &#8220;I&#8217;m not book-learned, as I&#8217;ve
told ye; but there&#8217;s little that isn&#8217;t
taught at St. Andrew&#8217;s that Christian
lads ought to know; to say nothing of
God&#8217;s holy law, which is best of all; but
of navigation I never hear tell. I&#8217;m
thinking it can&#8217;t be much good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No good!&#8221; repeated the Captain,
staring. &#8220;Navigation no good! Lord!
You&#8217;re off your reckoning thar sure,
Padre. Do you know what navigation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
means? It means standing on your
quarter-deck and making your ship take
its way over three thousand miles of
ocean straight as a bird flies to its nest;
it means holding her in that ar way
with the waves a-swelling mountain
high and the wind a-bellowing in your
rigging, and a rocky shore with all its
teeth set to grind her in your lee; it
means knowing how to look to the sun
and the stars when they&#8217;re shining, and
how to steer without, them when the
night is too black to see. Where would
you and I be now, Padre, if a navigator
that no landlubbers could down had
not struck out without map or chart to
find this here America of ours hundreds
of years ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered
Brother Bart. &#8220;But there seems to be
sense and truth in what you say. It&#8217;s a
pity you haven&#8217;t the light of Faith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would it do for me!&#8221; asked
Captain Jeb, briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would it do for you?&#8221; repeated
Brother Bart. &#8220;Sure it&#8217;s in the black
darkness you are, my man, or ye
wouldn&#8217;t ask. It&#8217;s sailing on the sea of
life ye are without sun or stars, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
how ye are to find the way to heaven
I don&#8217;t know. Do ye ever say a prayer,
Jeroboam?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the gruff answer. &#8220;That&#8217;s
your business, Padre. The Lord don&#8217;t
expect no praying from rough old salts
like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure and He does,&mdash;He does,&#8221; said
Brother Bart, roused into simple earnestness.
&#8220;What is high or low to Him?
Isn&#8217;t He the Lord and Maker of the
land and sea? Doesn&#8217;t He give ye life
and breath and strength and health and
all that ye have? And to stand up like
a dumb brute under His eye and never
give Him a word of praise or thanks!
I wonder at ye, Jeroboam,&mdash;I do indeed!
Sure ye&#8217;d be more dacent to any
mortal man that gave ye a bit and sup;
but what ye&#8217;re not taught, poor man, ye
can&#8217;t know. Listen now: ye&#8217;re to take
us to church to-morrow according to
your bargain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Captain, gruffly; &#8220;but
thar warn&#8217;t no bargain about preaching
and praying and singing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I don&#8217;t ask it,&#8221; said Brother
Bart, sadly. &#8220;You&#8217;re in haythen darkness,
Jeroboam, and I haven&#8217;t the wisdom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
or the knowledge or the holiness to
lade ye out; but there&#8217;s one prayer can
be said in darkness as well as in light.
All I ask ye to do is to stand for a moment
within the church and turn your
eyes to the lamp that swings like a
beacon light before the altar and whisper
the words of that honest man in the
Bible that didn&#8217;t dare to go beyant the
holy door, &#8216;O God, be merciful to me a
sinner!&#8217; Will ye do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, since that&#8217;s all ye ask of me,
Padre,&#8221; said Captain Jeb, reflectively,
&#8220;I can&#8217;t say no. I&#8217;ve thought them
words many a time when the winds was
a-howling and the seas a-raging, and it
looked as if I was bound for Davy
Jones&#8217; Locker before day; but I never
knew that was a fair-weather prayer.
But I&#8217;ll say it as you ask; and I&#8217;ll avow,
Padre, that, for talking and praying
straight to the point, you beat any
preacher or parson I ever heard yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Preach, is it!&#8221; exclaimed Brother
Bart. &#8220;Sure I never preached in my
life, and never will. But I&#8217;ll hold ye to
your word, Jeroboam; and, with God&#8217;s
blessing, we&#8217;ll be off betimes to-morrow
morning.&mdash;Here come the boys: and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
Holy Mother, look at the boatful of
clawing craythurs they have with
them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lobsters, Brother Bart!&#8221; shouted
Freddy, triumphantly. &#8220;Lobsters, Captain
Jeb! Fine big fellows. I&#8217;m hungry
as three bears.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XIII.&mdash;At Beach Cliff.</p>
</div>

<p>Brother Bart and his boys were up
betimes for their Sunday journey.
Breakfast was soon dispatched, and
four sunburned youngsters were ready
for their trip to town. Dud and Jim,
who had been lounging around Killykinick
in sweaters and middies, were
spruced up into young gentlemen
again. Freddy&#8217;s rosy cheeks were set off
by a natty little sailor suit and cap;
while Dan scarcely recognized himself
in one of the rigs presented by Brother
Francis, that bore the stamp of a
stylish tailor, and that had been
sponged and pressed and mended by the
kind old wardrobian until it was quite
as good as new.</p>
<p>The day was bright and beautiful,
sky and sea seemed smiling on each
other most amicably. The &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221;
was in the best of spirits, and the wind
in the friendliest of moods.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit steady, boys, and don&#8217;t be philandering!&#8221;
warned Brother Bart, anxiously.
&#8220;It looks fair and aisy enough,
but you can drown in sun as well as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
storm. Keep still there, laddie, or ye&#8217;ll
be over the edge of the boat. Sure it&#8217;s
an awful thing to think that there&#8217;s
only a board between ye and the judgment-seat
of God.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Brother Bart shook his head,
and relapsed into meditation befitting
the peril of his way; while the &#8220;Sary
Ann&#8221; swept on, past rock and reef and
shoal, out into the wide blue open,
where the sunlit waves were swelling in
joyous freedom, until the rocks and
spires of Beech Cliff rose dimly on the
horizon; white-winged sails began to
flutter into sight; wharves and boat-houses
came into view, and the travellers
were back in the busy world of men
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;It feels good to be on God&#8217;s own
earth again,&#8221; said Brother Bart, as he
set foot on the solid pier, gay just now
with a holiday crowd; for the morning
boat was in, and the &#8220;Cliff Dwellers,&#8221;
as the residents of the old town were
called at livelier seaside resorts, were
out in force to welcome the new arrivals.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something fine!&#8221; said Dud to
Jim, as they made their way through
the chatting, laughing throng, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
caught the lilt of the music on the
beach beyond, where bathers, reckless
of the church bells&#8217; call, were disporting
themselves in the sunlit waves. &#8220;It&#8217;s
tough, with a place like this so near, to
be shut up on a desert island for a
whole vacation. I say, Jim, let&#8217;s look
up the Fosters after Mass, and see if we
can&#8217;t get a bid to their house for a day
or two. We&#8217;ll have some fun there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered easy Jim.
&#8220;Killykinick is good enough for me.
You have to do so much fussing and
fixing when you are with girls. Still,
now we are here, we might as well look
around us.&#8221;</p>
<p>So when Mass in the pretty little
church was over, and Brother Bart,
glad to be back under his well-loved
altar light, lingered at his prayers, the
boys, who had learned from Captain
Jeb that they had a couple of hours still
on their hands, proceeded to explore the
quaint old town, with its steep, narrow
streets, where no traffic policemen were
needed; for neither street cars nor
automobiles were allowed to intrude.</p>
<p>In the far long ago, Beach Cliff had
been a busy and prosperous seaport
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
town. The great sailing vessels of
those days, after long and perilous
voyage, made harbor there; the old
shipmasters built solid homes on the
island shores; its merchants grew rich
on the whaling vessels, that went forth
to hunt for these monsters of the great
deep, and came back laden with oil and
blubber and whalebone and ambergris.
But all this was changed now. Steam
had come to supplant the white wings
that had borne the old ships on their
wide ocean ways. As Captain Jeb said,
&#8220;the airth had taken to spouting up ile,&#8221;
and made the long whale hunts needless
and unprofitable. But, though it had
died to the busy world of commerce and
trade, the quaint old island town had
kept a charm all its own, that drew
summer guests from far and near.</p>
<p>Dud and Jim made for the resident
streets, where old Colonial mansions
stood amid velvety lawns, and queer
little low-roofed houses were buried in
vines and flowers. But Dan and Freddy
kept to the shore and the cliff, where
the old fishermen had their homes, and
things were rough and interesting.
They stopped at an old weather-beaten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
house that had in its low windows all
sorts of curious things&mdash;models of ships
and boats, odd bits of pottery, rude
carvings, old brasses and mirrors,&mdash;the
flotsam and jetsam from broken homes
and broken lives that had drifted into
this little eddy.</p>
<p>The proprietor, a bent and grizzled
old man, who stood smoking at the door,
noticed the young strangers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do business on Sundays; but
you can step in, young gentlemen, and
look about you. &#8217;Twon&#8217;t cost you a
cent: and I&#8217;ve things you won&#8217;t see any-whar
else on this Atlantic coast,&mdash;brass,
pottery, old silver, old books, old papers,
prints of rare value and interest.
A Harvard professor spent two hours
the other day looking over my collection.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a museum?&#8221; asked Freddy
politely, as he and Dan peered doubtful
over the dusky threshold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wal, no, not exactly; though it&#8217;s
equal to that, sonny. Folks call this
here Jonah&#8217;s junk-shop,&mdash;Jonah being
my Christian name. (I ain&#8217;t never had
much use for any other.) I&#8217;ve been here
forty years, and my father was here before
me,&mdash;buying and selling whatever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
comes to us. And things do come to us
sure, from copper kettles that would
serve a mess of sixty men, down to
babies&#8217; bonnets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Babies&#8217; bonnets!&#8221; laughed Dan, who,
with Freddy close behind him, had
pushed curiously but cautiously into the
low, dark room, from which opened another
and another, crowded with
strangely assorted merchandise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may laugh,&#8221; said the proprietor,
&#8220;but we&#8217;ve had more than a dozen
trunks and boxes filled with such like
folderols. Some of &#8217;em been here
twenty years or more,&mdash;shawls and
bonnets and ball dresses, all frills and
laces and ribbons; baby bonnets, too, all
held for duty and storage or wreckage
and land knows what. Flung the whole
lot out for auction last year, and the
women swarmed like bees from the big
hotels and the cottages. Got bits of yellow
lace, they said, for ten cents that
was worth many dollars. The men folks
tried to &#8216;kick&#8217; about fever and small-pox
in the old stuff, but not a woman would
listen. Look at that now!&#8221; And the
speaker paused under a chandelier that,
even in the dusky dimness, glittered
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
with crystal pendants. &#8220;Set that ablaze
with the fifty candles it was made to
hold, and I bet a hundred dollars
wouldn&#8217;t have touched it forty years
ago. Ye can buy it to-morrow for three
and a quarter. That&#8217;s the way things
go in Jonah&#8217;s junk-shop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you ever really sell anything?&#8221;
asked Dan, whose keen business
eye, being trained by early bargaining
for the sharp needs of life, could see
nothing in Jonah&#8217;s collection worth a
hard-earned dollar. Mirrors with dingy
and broken frames loomed ghost-like up
in the dusky corners; tarnished epaulets
and sword hilts told pathetically of forgotten
honors; there were clocks, tall
and stately, without works or pendulum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sell?&#8221; echoed the proprietor. &#8220;Of
course, sonny, we sell considerable,
specially this time of year when the rich
folks come around,&mdash;folks that ain&#8217;t
looking for stuff that&#8217;s whole or shiny.
And they do bite curious, sure. Why,
there was some sort of a big man come
up here in his yacht a couple of years
ago that gave me twenty-five dollars for
a furrin medal,&mdash;twenty-five dollars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
cash down. And it wasn&#8217;t gold or silver
neither. Said he knew what it was
worth, and I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five dollars!&#8221; exclaimed the
astonished Freddy,&mdash;&#8220;twenty-five dollars
for a medal! O Dan, then maybe
yours is worth something, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh, no!&#8221; said Dan, &#8220;what would
poor old Nutty be doing with a twenty-five
dollar medal?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dull eyes of the old junk dealer
kindled with quick interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hev you got a medal?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From a batty old sailor man who
thought I had done him some good
turns,&#8221; answered Dan. &#8220;Where he got
it he didn&#8217;t say. I don&#8217;t think he could
remember.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan, whose only safe deposit for
boyish treasures was his jacket pocket,
pulled out the gift that Freddy had
refused, and showed it to this new acquaintance,
who, holding it off in his
horny hand, blinked at it with practised
eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Portugee or Spanish, I don&#8217;t know
which it says on that thar rim. Thar
ain&#8217;t much of it silver. I&#8217;d have to rub
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
it up to be sure of the rest. Date, well
as I can make out, it&#8217;s 1850.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is,&#8221; said Dan. &#8220;I made that much
out myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Old Jonah shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t far enough back. Takes a good
hundred years to make an antique. Still,
you can&#8217;t tell. The ways of these great
folks are queer. Last week I sold for
five dollars a bureau that I was thinking
of splitting up into firewood; and
the woman was as tickled as if she had
found a purse of money. Said it was
Louey Kans. Who or what she was I
don&#8217;t know; mebbe some kin of hers. I
showed her the break plain, for I ain&#8217;t
no robber; but she said that didn&#8217;t
count a mite,&mdash;that she could have a
new glass put in for ten dollars. Ten
dollars! Wal, thar ain&#8217;t no telling about
rich folks&#8217; freaks and foolishness; so I
can&#8217;t say nothing about that thar medal.
It ain&#8217;t the kind of thing I&#8217;d want to
gamble on. But if you&#8217;d like to leave it
here on show. I&#8217;ll take care of it, I
promise you; and mebbe some one may
come along and take a notion to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the good?&#8221; said Dan,
hesitating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Dan, do&mdash;do!&#8221; pleaded Freddy, who
saw a chance for the vacation pocket
money his chum so sorely lacked. &#8220;You
might get twenty-five dollars for it,
Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He might,&#8221; said old Jonah; &#8220;and
then again he mightn&#8217;t, sonny. I ain&#8217;t
promising any more big deals like them
I told you about. But you can&#8217;t ever
tell in this here junk business whar or
when luck will strike you. It goes hard
agin my old woman to hev all this here
dust and cobwebs. She has got as tidy
a house as you&#8217;d ask to see just around
the corner,&mdash;flower garden in front, and
everything shiny. But if I&#8217;d let her in
here with a bucket and broom she&#8217;d ruin
my business forever. It&#8217;s the dust and
the rust and the cobwebs that runs
Jonah&#8217;s junk-shop. But it&#8217;s fair and
square. I put down in writing all folks
give me to sell, and sign my name to it.
If you don&#8217;t gain nothing, you don&#8217;t lose
nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan was thinking fast. Twenty-five
dollars,&mdash;twenty-five dollars! There was
only a chance, it is true; and a very slim
chance at that. But what would twenty-five
dollars mean to him, to Aunt Winnie?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
For surely and steadily, in the
long, pleasant summer days, in the starlit
watches of the night, his resolution
was growing: he must live and work for
Aunt Winnie; he could not leave her
gentle heart to break in its loneliness,
while he climbed to heights beyond her
reach; he could not let her die, while he
dreamed of a future she would never
see. Being only a boy, Dan did not put
the case in just such words. He only
felt with a fierce determination that, in
spite of the dull pain in his heart at the
thought, he must give up St. Andrew&#8217;s
when this brief seaside holiday was
past, and work for Aunt Winnie. And a
little ready cash to make a new start in
Mulligan&#8217;s upper rooms would help
matters immensely. Just now he had
not money enough for a fire in the rusty
little stove, or to move Aunt Winnie
and her old horsehair trunk from the
Little Sisters.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; he said, with sudden resolve.
&#8220;Take the medal and try it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And old Jonah, who was not half so
dull as, for commercial purposes, he
looked, turned to an old mahogany desk
propped up on three legs, and gave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
young owner a duly signed receipt for
one silver-rimmed bronze medal, date
1850, and the business was concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you really get twenty-five
dollars, Dan,&#8221; said Freddy, as they
bade old Jonah good-bye and kept on
their way. &#8220;What will you do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying,&#8221; replied Dan, mindful
of his promise to Father Mack. &#8220;But
I&#8217;ll start something, you can bet,
Freddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then they went on down to the
wharf, where the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221; lay at her
moorings, and Brother Bart was seated
on a bench in pleasant converse with
the Irish sexton of the little church,
who had been showing the friendly old
Brother some of the sights of the town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here come my boys now. This is
Dan Dolan, and this is my own laddie
that I&#8217;ve been telling ye about, Mr.
McNally. And where&mdash;where are the
others?&#8221; questioned Brother Bart,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; answered Dan, after
he had reciprocated Mr. McNally&#8217;s
hearty hand-shake. &#8220;Dud said something
about going to the Fosters.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure and that isn&#8217;t hard to find,&#8221;
said Mr. McNally. &#8220;It&#8217;s one of the
biggest places on Main Street, with
hydrangeas growing like posies all
around the door. Any one will show
ye.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go back for them, Danny lad. Ye
can leave laddie here with me while ye
bring the others back; for the day is
passing, and we must be sailing home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XIV.&mdash;Polly.</p>
</div>

<p>Main Street was not hard to find,
neither seemed the Fosters. A corner
druggist directed Dan without hesitation
to a wide, old-fashioned house, surrounded
by lawns and gardens, in which
the hydrangeas&mdash;blue, pink, purple&mdash;were
in gorgeous summer bloom. But,
though the broad porch was gay with
cushions and hammocks, no boys were
in sight; and, lifting the latch of the
iron gate, Dan was proceeding up the
flower-girdled path to the house, when
the hall door burst open and a pretty
little girl came flying down the steps in
wild alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bobby!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;My Bobby is
out! Bobby is gone! Oh, somebody
catch Bobby, please,&mdash;somebody catch
my Bobby!&#8221;</p>
<p>A gush of song answered the wail.
Perched upon the biggest and pinkest of
the hydrangeas was a naughty little
canary, its head on one side warbling
defiantly in the first thrill of joyous
freedom. Its deserted mistress paused
breathlessly. A touch, a movement, she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
knew would send him off into sunlit
space beyond her reach forever.</p>
<p>Quick-witted Dan caught on to the
situation. A well-aimed toss of his cap,
and the hydrangea blooms were quivering
under the beat of the captive&#8217;s
fluttering wings. Dan sprang forward
and with a gentle, cautious hand
grasped his prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, oh, oh!&#8221; was all the little lady
could cry, clasping her hands rapturously.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t hurt him, please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;But get
his cage quick; for he&#8217;s scared to death
at my holding him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bobby&#8217;s mistress darted into the
house at the word, and reappeared
again in a moment with a gilded palace
that was surely all a bird could ask for.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Bobby, Bobby!&#8221; she murmured
reproachfully, as Dan deposited his subdued
and trembling captive behind the
glittering bars. &#8220;When you had this
lovely new cage and everything you
wanted!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he hadn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dan, conscious
of a sudden sympathy with his feathered
prisoner. &#8220;He has wings and wants
to use them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But he couldn&#8217;t find seed or chickweed
for himself, and the cats and
hawks would have had him before
morning. Oh, I&#8217;m so glad to get him
back safe I don&#8217;t know how to thank
you for catching him for me!&#8221; And the
little lady lifted a pair of violet eyes,
that were still sparkling with tears, to
her benefactor&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pooh! It wasn&#8217;t anything,&#8221; said
Dan, shyly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was. You threw your cap
fine. My brothers couldn&#8217;t have done it,
I know. They would have just laughed
and teased, and let Bobby fly away forever.
You are the nicest boy I ever
saw,&#8221; continued Bobby&#8217;s mistress, who
was at the age when young ladies speak
their mind frankly. &#8220;What is your
name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan,&#8221; was the reply, with the
smile that showed Aunt Winnie&#8217;s boy at
his best. &#8220;Let me carry your bird cage
to the house for you. It is too heavy for
a little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you! But I&#8217;m not such a
little girl as you think: I am nearly ten
years old,&#8221; said the young lady, as Dan
took up Bobby and his cage, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
proceeded up the broad gravelled path
to the house; &#8220;and my name is Polly
Forester, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forester!&#8221; blurted out Dan. &#8220;Then
I&#8217;m on the wrong track. They told me
this was the Foster house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; Miss Polly shook her head,
that, with its golden brown ringlets,
looked very much like a flower itself.
&#8220;This has been our house for more than
a hundred years. My grandfather lived
here, and my great-grandfather and all
my grandfathers. One of them fought
with George Washington; we&#8217;ve got his
sword. Would you like to see it?&#8221; asked
Miss Polly, becoming graciously hospitable
as they approached the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I haven&#8217;t time,&#8221; answered
Dan. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;m looking for two of
our fellows. We&#8217;re a lot of St. Andrew&#8217;s
boys off for the summer, and the boat is
waiting to take us back to Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you staying there?&#8221; asked
the young lady, with wide-eyed interest.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve passed it often in dad&#8217;s yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Polly dear!&#8221; called a sweet voice,
and a grown-up image of that young
person came hurriedly out on the
porch,&mdash;a lovely lady, all in soft trailing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
white and blue ribbons. &#8220;What is the
matter? Your cry woke me out of a
sound sleep and put me all in a flutter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O mamma dear, I&#8217;m sorry! But it
was Bobby. He flew out of his cage
when I was trying to teach him to perch
on my hand, and got away. He would
have gone forever if this nice boy had
not caught him for me! His name is
Dan Dolan, mamma, and he is staying
at Killykinick with a lot of college boys.
Dan is looking for the other boys, who
are at the Fosters; and some one told
him this was the house, and he came
just in time to catch my Bobby under
his cap, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Fosters?&#8221; interrupted mamma,
who was used to clearing up things for
Polly. &#8220;Probably you are looking for
Colonel Foster, who came down last
week,&#8221; she continued, turning a smiling
face to Dan. &#8220;They have rented the
Pelham cottage for the summer. You
know where that is, Polly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221; answered the little lady,
cheerfully. &#8220;You take care of Bobby,
mamma, and I&#8217;ll show Dan the short
cut through our garden.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>And she darted ahead through an old-fashioned
maze, where tall box hedges
were clipped into queer shapes around
beds of gay blooming flowers. Then,
swinging open a vine-wreathed gate,
Dan&#8217;s little guide led into a steep narrow
way paved with cobblestones.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pelham cottage is just up there,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;at the top of Larboard Lane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And here the boys come now!&#8221; exclaimed
Dan, as the sound of familiar
voices reached his ear, and down the
lane came a laughing, chattering
group,&mdash;Minna Foster, and her sister
Madge and brother Jack gleefully
escorting Jim and Dud back to the boat,
and claiming the promises of speedy return
to Beach Cliff.</p>
<p>Dan hailed his schoolmates, explained
his search and his mistake, and they
were all taking their way down the
stony path together,&mdash;Polly being of the
sort to make friends at once with every
nice boy or girl within reach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t she the cutest thing?&#8221; said
Minna Foster, who had fallen behind
with Dud. &#8220;We have just been dying
to know them; but her mother is an
invalid, and doesn&#8217;t go out much,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
though they are the finest people in
Beach Cliff, mamma says. They have
lots of money, and the loveliest old home
filled with all sorts of beautiful things,
and horses and carriages and a big
yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Dan Dolan has struck it with
them,&#8221; said Dud, watching Miss Polly&#8217;s
dancing along loyally by her nice boy&#8217;s
side. &#8220;Dan Dolan! Can&#8217;t you give them
a tip about him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A tip?&#8221; echoed Minna, puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dud, his brow darkening.
&#8220;People like that don&#8217;t want to know
such low-down chumps as Dan Dolan.
Why, he&#8217;s in St. Andrew&#8217;s on charity;
hasn&#8217;t got a decent rag to his back except
what we give him there; used to
shine shoes and sell papers on the
streets. His aunt is in the poorhouse or
something next to it; he&#8217;s just a common
tough, without a cent to call his
own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness!&#8221; gasped Miss Minna.
&#8220;Then what is he doing up here with
boys like you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pushed in,&#8221; answered Dud, hotly.
&#8220;He has enough nerve to push anywhere.
St. Andrew&#8217;s gives a scholarship
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
at the parochial school, and he
won it; and, as he hadn&#8217;t any place to
go this summer, they bunched him in
with us. But you can see what he is
at one look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I did,&mdash;I did!&#8221; murmured
Miss Minna. &#8220;I saw at the very first
that he was not our sort; but, being
with nice boys like you, I thought he
must be all right. He isn&#8217;t bad-looking,
and such nerve for a bootblack!
Just look how he is making
up to little Polly Forester!&#8221;</p>
<p>To an impartial observer it would
have really seemed the other way.
Polly herself was &#8220;making up&#8221; most
openly to this nicest boy she ever saw.
Tripping along by Dan&#8217;s side, she was
extending a general invitation, in
which Dan was specialized above all
others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to have a birthday
party next week, and I want you to
come, and bring all the other boys
from Killykinick. It&#8217;s the first party
I&#8217;ve ever had; but mamma is feeling
better this year, and I&#8217;ll be ten years
old, and she&#8217;s going to have things
just lovely for me,&mdash;music and dancing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and ice-cream made into flowers
and birds, and a Jack Horner pie with
fine presents in it. Wouldn&#8217;t you like
to come, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; was the ready answer;
for a party of young persons like Miss
Polly was, from his outlook, a very
simple affair. &#8220;When is it coming off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thursday,&#8221; said Polly,&mdash;&#8220;Thursday
evening at six, in our garden. And
you needn&#8217;t dress up. Boys hate to
dress up, I know; Tom and Jack
won&#8217;t go any place where they have
to wear stiff collars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with them there,&#8221; rejoined
Dan. &#8220;Had to get into one on Commencement
Day, and never want to
try another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I don&#8217;t care for some
boys,&#8221; said the expectant hostess, confidentially.
&#8220;All Tom&#8217;s and Jack&#8217;s
friends are in long trousers. Some
girls like that, but I don&#8217;t: they look
too grown up, and they stand around
and tease, and won&#8217;t play games, and
are just horrid. You would play
games, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just try me at them,&#8221; answered
Dan, grinning.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know you would! So I want
you all to come,&#8221; said Miss Polly, who,
having reached her own gateway,
paused for a general good-bye. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know your names, but I want
you all to come with Dan to
my party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can get here,&#8221; replied Dan.
&#8220;Captain Jeb wouldn&#8217;t trust us to sail
his boat, and I don&#8217;t know that he
could come with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he will,&mdash;he must!&#8221; persisted
Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;He ain&#8217;t the will-and-must kind,&#8221;
said Dan, nodding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then maybe I can send for you,&#8221;
the little lady went on eagerly. &#8220;My
cousins are coming over from Rock-haven
on dad&#8217;s yacht, and I&#8217;ll make
them stop at Killykinick and bring
you all with them to my party.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with a gay little nod that included
all her nice boys, little Miss
Polly disappeared among the hydrangeas;
while the others kept on down
to the wharf, where the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221;
was already swinging out her dingy
sail, and Brother Bart was growing
anxious and nervous.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>Merry good-byes were spoken, and
very soon the boys were on their
homeward way, with Beach Cliff vanishing
in the distance. There had been
no bids to the Fosters&#8217; cottage, which
was already filled with grown-up
guests. Dud was sullen and disappointed;
lazy Jim a little tired;
while Freddy, seated in the bottom of
the boat, dropped his curly head on
Brother Bart&#8217;s knee and went off to
sleep. But to Dan the day had been
a most pleasant experience, a glimpse
of a friendly, beautiful world whose
gates he had never thought to pass;
and Aunt Winnie&#8217;s Dan was very
happy as he steered the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221;
over a smiling summer sea without a
clouding shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you push in so quick to
the Foresters?&#8221; sneered Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looking for two lost donkeys,&#8221; retorted
Dan, who was learning to give
Dud as good as he sent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you think you&#8217;ll get there
again,&#8221; said Dud. &#8220;Well you won&#8217;t, I
can tell you that. It was all very well
to make up so strong to a little fool
girl; but they are the tiptoppers of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Beach Cliff, and you won&#8217;t hear any
more of Miss Polly&#8217;s yacht or her
party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not worrying over that, are
you?&#8221; said Dan, philosophically.
&#8220;You look as if you had a grouch on
about something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; blurted out Dud fiercely.
&#8220;I hate this horrid Killykinick and
everything on it; and I&#8217;m not going to
be mixed up before decent people
with roughs and toughs that are fit
only to black my boots&mdash;like you, Dan
Dolan!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XV.&mdash;A Rescue.</p>
</div>

<p>For a moment Dan&#8217;s blue eyes flashed,
his strong arm quivered. Every
hardy nerve was tingling to strike out
at the insolent speaker who lost no
opportunity to fling a scornful word.
But this beautiful day had left holy as
well as happy memories. Dan had
knelt at Brother Bart&#8217;s side before the
altar light, that through all his hard
rough young life had been Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s boy&#8217;s beacon,&mdash;a beacon
that had grown clearer and brighter
with his advancing years, until it
seemed to rise above earth into the
dazzling radiance of the stars. Its
steady light fell upon his rising passion
now, and his fury broke as the
swelling surf breaks upon the beacon
rock&mdash;into foam and spray.</p>
<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> a sort of mix up, I must say,&#8221;
he answered. &#8220;But I&#8217;m out of the bootblack
business for good and all; so
what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut the whole lot,&#8221; said Dud,
&#8220;just as soon as I can get money
enough to do it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t cry after you, I&#8217;m
sure,&#8221; retorted Dan, good-humoredly;
though there was a spark in his eye
that told the fire was smoldering
still, as even under the beacon light
such fires sometimes do.</p>
<p>But a stentorian shout from Captain
Jeb put an end to the altercation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind&#8217;s a-veering! Swing round
that ar boom, matey Dan! Duck, the
rest of you boys,&mdash;duck&mdash;quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>Freddy was asleep, with his head
pillowed safely on Brother Bart&#8217;s
knee. Jim was dozing in the stern, out
of harm&#8217;s reach; but on Dud, seated
at the edge of the boat and fuming
with rage and pride, the warning fell
unheeded. As the sail swung round
there was s splash, a shriek.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s overboard! God have mercy
on us!&#8221; cried Brother Bart, roused
from his third Glorious Mystery of the
Rosary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you to duck, ye
rascal?&#8221; roared Captain Jeb, to
whom a tumble like this seemed only
a boy&#8217;s fool trick. &#8220;Back aboard with
ye, ye young fool! Back&mdash;aboard!
Don&#8217;t ye know there&#8217;s sharks about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
in these waters? Lord, ef he ain&#8217;t
gone down!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t&mdash;can&#8217;t swim!&#8221; And Jim,
who had started up half awake and
who could swim like a duck, was just
about to plunge after Dud, when he
caught the word that chilled even his
young blood to ice&mdash;<i>sharks</i>! Jim knew
what sharks meant. He had seen a big
colored man in his own Southern
waters do battle with one, and had
sickened at the memory ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;A rope,&mdash;a rope!&#8221; thundered Captain
Jeb, whose right leg had been
stiffened for all swimming in deep
waters ten years ago. &#8220;If he goes
down again, it&#8217;s forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O God have mercy! God have
mercy!&#8221; prayed Brother Bart, helplessly;
while Freddy shrieked in shrill
alarm.</p>
<p>In that first wild moment of outcry
Dan had stood breathless while a tide
of feeling swept over him that held
him mute, motionless. Dud! It was
Dud who had been swept over into
those foaming, seething depths. Dud,
whose stinging words were still rankling
in his thoughts and heart; Dud,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
who hated, scorned, despised him;
Dud who could not swim, and&mdash;and
there were sharks,&mdash;sharks!</p>
<p>Dan was trembling now in every
strong limb,&mdash;trembling, it seemed
to him, in body and soul. Sharks!
Sharks! And it was Dud.&mdash;Dud who
had said Dan was fit only to black
his boots!</p>
<p>&#8220;O God have mercy! Mother
Mary&mdash;Mother Mary save him!&#8221;
prayed Brother Bart.</p>
<p>At the words Dan steadied,&mdash;steadied
to the beacon light,&mdash;steadied into
Aunt Winnie&#8217;s boy again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scare, Brother Bart!&#8221; rang
out his clear young voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan! Dan!&#8221; shrieked Freddy, as,
with the practised dive of the Wharf
Rats, the lithe young form plunged
into the water. &#8220;O Dan,&mdash;my Dan, the
sharks will get you, too! Come back!
Come back, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan caught the words as he struck
out blindly, desperately, almost hopelessly,
through depths such as he had
never braved before. For this was not
the safe land-bound harbor; this was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
not the calm lap of the river around
the sheltering wharf; this was a
world of waters, seething, surging
roaring around him, peopled with
hunting creatures hungry for prey.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan, Dan!&#8221; came his little chum&#8217;s
piercing cry as he rose for breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back, ye fool!&#8221; thundered
Captain Jeb. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone, I tell ye,&mdash;the
boy is gone down!&#8221;</p>
<p>But even at the shout something
dark swept within touch of Dan&#8217;s outstretched
arm; he made a clutch at it
and grasped Dud,&mdash;Dud choking,
gasping, struggling,&mdash;Dud, who sinking
for the last time, caught Dan in
a grip that meant death for both
of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let go!&#8221; spluttered Dan, fiercely,&mdash;&#8220;let
go! Let go or we&#8217;ll drown
together!&#8221; And then, as the deadly
clutch only tightened, Dan did what
all Wharf Rats knew they must do
in such cases&mdash;struck out with the
full strength of his hardy young fist,
and, knocking the clinging Dud&#8217;s
fast-failing wits completely out of
him, swam back with his helpless
burden to the &#8220;Sary Ann.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord, matey, but you are a
game un!&#8221; said Captain Jeb, as he
and Jim dragged Dud aboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, God have mercy upon the
poor lad&#8217;s soul! It&#8217;s dead entirely he
is!&#8221; sobbed Brother Bart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it!&#8221; said Dan, scrambling
up the side of the &#8220;Sary Ann.&#8221;
&#8220;He&#8217;s just knocked out. I had to
knock him out, or he would have
pulled me down with him. Roll him
over a little, so he can spit out the
water, and he&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure he is,&mdash;he is!&#8221; murmured
Brother Bart, as Dud began to cough
and splutter encouragingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s gone
forever I thought he was, poor lad!
Oh, God bless you for this day&#8217;s work,
Dan Dolan,&mdash;bless you and keep you
His forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a close shave for all
hands,&#8221; said Captain Jeb, permitting
himself a long-drawn sigh of relief,
as Dan, after shaking himself like a
water-dog, sank down, a little pale
and breathless, at his side. &#8220;And you
were what most folk would call a consarned
fool, matey. Didn&#8217;t you hear
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
me say these &#8217;ere waters had sharks
in &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dan, whose eyes were
fixed upon a drift of sunlit cloud in
the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then what the deuce did you do it
for?&#8221; said Captain Jeb, severely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t let a fellow drown,&#8221; was
the brief answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Warn&#8217;t nothing special to you, was
he?&#8221; growled the old sailor, who was
still fiercely resentful of his &#8220;scare.&#8221;
&#8220;Ain&#8217;t ever been perticular nice or
soft spoken as I ever heard to you.
And you jumping in to be gobbled by
sharks, for him, like he was your own
twin brother! You&#8217;re a fool, matey,&mdash;a
durn young fool!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan, who understood his old
sailor friend, only laughed,&mdash;laughed
while his eyes still followed the drift
of swinging cloud fringing the deep
blue of the sky. They were like the
robe of the only Mother he had
ever known,&mdash;the sweet Mother on
whom Brother Bart had called to
save Dud. And Dan had heard and
obeyed and he felt with a happy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
heart his Mother was smiling on him
now.</p>
<p>But to Dud this thrilling adventure
left no pleasant memories. He was sick
for several days from his overdose of
salt water, weak and nervous from
fright and shock: there was a bruise
over his eye from the saving impact
of Dan&#8217;s sturdy fist, which he resented
unreasonably. More than all, he resented
the chorus that went up from
all at Killykinick in praise of Dan&#8217;s
heroism.</p>
<p>Jim testified openly and honestly
that the cry of &#8220;Sharks&#8221; got him, and
he couldn&#8217;t have dared a plunge in
those waters to save his own brother.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw a nigger cut in half by one
of those man-eaters once, and it
makes my flesh creep to think of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even dull-witted old Neb rose to
show appreciation of Dan&#8217;s bold
plunge, and said he &#8220;reckoned all
boys wuth anything did sech fool
tricks some times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Good old Brother Bart felt it was a
time for warning and exhortation,
which Dud found altogether exasperating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s on your knees you ought
to go morning and evening to thank
God for bold, brave Dan Dolan. If
it hadn&#8217;t been for him, it&#8217;s food for
the fishes ye&#8217;d be now. The Lord was
merciful to ye, lad; for I&#8217;m misdoubting
if ye were fit for heaven. Though
it&#8217;s not for me to judge, ye have a
black look betimes, as if God&#8217;s grace
wasn&#8217;t in yer heart. This ought to be
a lesson to ye, a lesson that ye should
never forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not likely to forget it,&#8221; was the
grim answer. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t if I tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;m glad to hear ye say so,&#8221;
said the simple-minded old Brother.
&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking sometimes ye&#8217;re not
over friendly with Dan. It was a
rough bating he gave ye before we
left the college.&#8221; (Dud&#8217;s black looks
grew blacker at the memory.) &#8220;But
he has more than made it up to ye
now, for he has given ye back yer
life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what are you going to give
him for it, Dud?&#8221; questioned Freddy
confidentially, as the good Brother
moved away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give who?&#8221; growled Dud, who
was sick and sore and savage over
the whole experience, and, strange to
say&mdash;but such are the peculiarities of
some natures,&mdash;felt as if he hated his
preserver more than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dud!&#8221; continued Freddy.
&#8220;You always give a person something
when he saves your life. Dick Walton
told me that a man saved him when
he was carried out in the surf last
summer, and his father gave the man
a gold watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Dan Dolan wants a gold watch,
does he?&#8221; said Dud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no!&#8221; answered Freddy, quite
unconscious of the sneer in the question.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Dan wants a gold
watch at all. He would not know
what to do with one. But if I were
you,&#8221; continued Dan&#8217;s little chum, his
eyes kindling with loyal interest, &#8220;I&#8217;d
make it a pocket-book,&mdash;a nice
leather pocket-book, with a place for
stamps and car tickets and money,
and I&#8217;d just fill it <i>chock</i> full. You see,
Dan hasn&#8217;t much pocket money. He
pulled out his purse the other day at
Beach Cliff to get a medal that was in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
it, and he had only a nickel and two
stamps to write to his aunt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So your brave Dan is striking for
ready cash, is he?&#8221; said Dud, in a tone
that even innocent Freddy could not
mistake, and that Dan coming up the
beach with a net full of kicking lobsters,
caught in all its sting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ready cash,&#8221; he asked, looking from
one to the other. &#8220;For what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pulling me out of the water the
other day,&#8221; answered Dud. &#8220;Freddy
says you&#8217;re expecting pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m <i>not</i>,&#8221; said Dan, the spark
flashing into his blue eyes. &#8220;You&#8217;re
&#8217;way off there, Freddy, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mean,&mdash;I didn&#8217;t say,&#8221;
began poor little Freddy, desperately.
&#8220;I only thought people always got
medals or watches or something when
they saved other people, and I told
Dud&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind what you told him, kid&#8221;
(Dan laid a kind hand on his little
chum&#8217;s shoulder); &#8220;you mean it all
right, I know. But Dud&#8221; (the spark in
the speaker&#8217;s eye flashed brighter,)&mdash;&#8220;Dud
didn&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; said Dud. &#8220;My father will
pay you all you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Dan blazed up indeed into Irish
fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want his pay: I wouldn&#8217;t
touch it. You ain&#8217;t worth it, Dud Fielding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t worth what? My father is
worth a million,&#8221; said Dud quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>That</i> for his million!&#8221; and Dan
snapped his two fishy fingers under
Dud&#8217;s Grecian nose. &#8220;You ain&#8217;t worth
a buffalo nickel, Dud Fielding; and I
wouldn&#8217;t ask one for saving your
measly little life.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan went off with his lobsters,
in a wrath almost fiery enough to boil
them alive. Pay!&mdash;pay for that wild
plunge into watery depths&mdash;the doubt,
the fear, the icy terror of hungry monsters
around him! Dud Fielding was
offering him pay for this, very much as
he might fling pay to him for blacking
his boots. Ah, it was a fierce, bad
moment for Dan! His beacon light
vanished; murky clouds of passion
were blackening dream and vision; he
felt he could cheerfully pitch Dud back
to the sharks again. And then, as still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
hot and furious, he strode back with his
lobsters to old Ned, Freddy, who was
remorsefully following him&mdash;remorseful
at having stirred up a row,&mdash;piped
up in sudden excitement:</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, look&mdash;look what&#8217;s coming
here to Killykinick! Dan, just look!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan turned at the cry. Past Numskull
Nob, making her cautious, graceful
way through rocks and shoals, was
a beautiful white-winged yacht, her
mast gay with pennants. One, fluttering
wide to the breeze, showed her name,
&#8220;The Polly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XVI.&mdash;A New Experience</p>
</div>

<p>Dan stood staring in blank amazement,
while Freddy&#8217;s voice rose into shriller
triumph:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, Dud, Brother Bart, look,&mdash;look
what is coming here!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was coming indeed, this white-winged
stranger, swaying to the right
and left under skilful guidance as she
made her way to the Killykinick wharf;
for her rugged old Captain knew the
perils of the shore. And under the gay
awnings that shaded the deck was a
merry group of young people, waving
their handkerchiefs to the rocky island
they were approaching; while Polly&#8217;s
big handsome &#8220;dad,&#8221; in white linen
yachting togs, pointed out the ship
house and the wharf, the tower and
garden patch,&mdash;all the improvements
that queer old Great-uncle Joe had made
on these once barren rocks. Polly&#8217;s dad
had known about the old captain and
his oddities all his life. Indeed, once in
his very early years as he now told his
young listeners, he had made a boyish
foray in Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s domain, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
had been repelled by the old sailor with
a vigor never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never had such a scientific thrashing
in my life,&#8221; laughed dad, as if he
rather enjoyed the remembrance. &#8220;We
were playing pirate that summer. I
had a new boat that we christened the
&#8216;Red Rover,&#8217; after Cooper&#8217;s story; and
we rigged her up with a pirate flag, and
proceeded to harry the coast and do all
the mischief that naughty twelve-year-olds
can do. Finally, I proposed, as a
crowning adventure, a descent upon
Killykinick, pulling down old Joey
Kane&#8217;s masthead and smashing his
lantern. Well, we caught a Tartar
there, I can tell you! The old captain
never had any use for boys. And to
think of the place being full of them
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, dad! There are only four,&#8221;
said Polly,&mdash;&#8220;four real nice boys from
St. Andrew&#8217;s College, and just the right
size to come to my party. O Nell,
Gracie, look! There they come!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the handkerchiefs fluttered
again gleefully as &#8220;The Polly&#8221; made up
to the wharf, and the whole population
of Killykinick turned out to greet her,&mdash;even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
to Brother Bart, who had been
reading his well-worn &#8220;Imitation&#8221; on
the beach; and Neb, who, with the bag
of potatoes he had just dug up, stood
staring dumbly in the distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Killykinick ahoy!&#8221; shouted dad,
making a speaking trumpet of his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Aye, aye</i>!&#8221; answered Captain Jeb,
with his crooked smile. &#8220;You&#8217;re &#8216;The
Polly&#8217; of Beach Cliff. What&#8217;s wanted,
Mr. Forester? Clams or lobsters?&#8221;&mdash;for
in these latter days Killykinick did
something of a trade in both with the
pleasure boats and cottages along the
coast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we don&#8217;t like to call them
either; do we, Polly?&#8221; laughed dad, as
he stepped ashore, while the little girls
crowded to the deck rail. &#8220;&#8216;The Polly&#8217;
is sailing under petticoat orders to-day
and is scouring the waters in search of
four boys that, we understand, you have
here at Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have,&#8221; answered Captain Jeb,&mdash;&#8220;or
at least the Padre here has. They&#8217;re
none of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no Padre, as I&#8217;ve told ye again
and again, Jeroboam,&#8221; interposed
Brother Bart. &#8220;I am only Brother Bartholomew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
from St. Andrew&#8217;s College.
And I have four boys here, but they&#8217;ve
been under my eye day and night,&#8221; he
continued anxiously; &#8220;so, in God&#8217;s
name, what are ye after them for, sir?
They have done ye nor yours no harm,
I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None in the world,&#8221; said Mr. Forester
quickly, as he saw his light speech
was not understood. &#8220;I was only joking
with Captain Jeb. My mission here,
I assure you, is most friendly. Permit
me to introduce myself, Brother Bar&mdash;Bar&mdash;Bartholomew&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye can make it Bart, sir, for short;
&#8217;most everyone does,&#8221; said the good
Brother, nodding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, Brother Bart, I am Mr. Pemberton
Forester, of Beach Cliff. I am
also known by the briefer and pleasanter
name of this little lady&#8217;s &#8216;dad,&#8217; and
it is in that official capacity I am here
to-day. It seems this little girl of mine
met your boys a few days ago at Beach
Cliff, where they rendered her most
valuable service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One&mdash;it was only one of them, dad!&#8221;
corrected Miss Polly&#8217;s silvery voice. &#8220;It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
was only Dan Dolan who caught my
bird and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, at all events, the acquaintance
progressed most pleasantly and rapidly,
as my daughter&#8217;s acquaintance is apt to
progress; and it resulted in an equally
pleasant understanding that the four
young gentlemen were to come to a little
festivity we are giving in honor of
Polly&#8217;s birthday,&mdash;a garden party in
our grounds, between the hours of six
and nine. This is the occasion of our
present visit, Brother Bart. Fearing
that travelling facilities might not be at
the young gentlemen&#8217;s disposal, we have
come to take them to Beach Cliff. If you
would like to accompany them&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To a party, is it?&#8221; exclaimed Brother
Bart, in dismay. &#8220;Me at a party! Sure
I&#8217;d look and feel queer indeed in such a
place.&#8221; Brother Bart&#8217;s glance turned
from the fine boat to the gentleman before
him; he felt the responsibilities of
his position were growing perplexing.
&#8220;It will be great sport for the boys, I
am sure,&#8221; he added; &#8220;and I don&#8217;t like to
say &#8216;No,&#8217; after all yer kindness in coming
for them. But how are they to get
back?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll see to that!&#8221; answered Mr.
Forester, cheerfully. &#8220;They will be
home and safe in your care, by half-past
ten,&mdash;I promise you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&mdash;hooray!&#8221; rose the shout,
that the boys who had been listening
breathlessly to this discussion could no
longer repress.</p>
<p>There was a wild rush to the shining
decks of &#8220;The Polly,&#8221; and soon all her
pretty passengers were helped ashore,
to scramble and climb as well as their
dainty little feet could over the rocks
and steeps of Killykinick, to wonder at
the gardens and flowers blooming in its
nooks and crannies, to peep into cow
house and chicken house, and even old
Neb&#8217;s galley,&mdash;to explore the &#8220;Lady
Jane&#8221; from stem to stern in delighted
amazement.</p>
<p>Nell and Gracie, who were a little
older than their cousin, took possession
of Jim and Dud; their small brother
Tad attached himself to Freddy, who
was about his own age; while Polly
claimed her own especial find, Dan, for
escort and guide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what a queer, queer place!&#8221; she
prattled, as, after peering cautiously
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
into the depths of the Devil&#8217;s Jaw, they
wended their way to safer slopes, where
the rocks were wreathed with hardy
vines, and the sea stretched smiling into
the sunlit distance. &#8220;Do you like it
here, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes: I&#8217;m having a fine time,&#8221; was
the cheery answer, for the moment all
the pricks and goads forgotten.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to stay long?&#8221; asked
Miss Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until September,&#8221; answered Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine!&#8221; said his small companion,
happily. &#8220;Then I&#8217;ll get dad to
bring me down here to see you again,
Dan; and you can come up in your
boat to see me, and we&#8217;ll be friends,&mdash;real
true friends. I haven&#8217;t had a real
true friend,&#8221; said Miss Polly, perching
herself on a ledge of rock, where, in her
pink dress and flower-trimmed hat, she
looked like a bright winged butterfly,&mdash;&#8220;not
since I lost Meg Murray.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lost her? Did she die?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; was the soft sighing answer.
&#8220;It was much worse than that. You
see&#8221; (Miss Polly&#8217;s tone became confidential),
&#8220;it was last summer, when I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
had the whooping cough. Did you ever
have the whooping cough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I did,&#8221; replied Dan, whose
memory of such minor ills was by no
means clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you know how awful it is. You
can&#8217;t go to school or out to play, or anywhere.
I had to stay in our own garden
and grounds by myself, because all the
girls&#8217; mothers were afraid of me. The
doctor said I must be out of doors, so I
had a play house away down by the high
box hedge in the maze; and took my
dolls and things out there, and made the
best of it. And then Meg found me. She
was coming down the lane one day, and
heard me talking to my dolls. I had to
talk to them because there was no one
else. And she peeped through the hedge
and asked if she could come in and see
them. I told her about the whooping
cough, but she said she wasn&#8217;t afraid:
that she had had it three times already,
and her mother was dead and wouldn&#8217;t
mind if she took it again. So she came
in, and we played all the morning; and
she came the next day and the next
for weeks and weeks. Oh, we did have
the grandest times together! You see,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
dad was away, and mamma was sick,
and there was no one to bother us. I
used to bring out apples and cookies and
chocolate drops, and we had parties
under the trees, and we promised to be
real true friends forever. I gave her
my pearl ring so she would always remember.
It was that pearl ring that
made all the trouble.&#8221; And Miss Polly&#8217;s
voice trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked Dan very gently. He
never had a sister or a girl cousin or
any one to soften his ways or speech;
and little Polly&#8217;s friendly trust was
something altogether new and strangely
sweet to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it broke up everything!&#8221; faltered
Miss Polly. &#8220;That evening an old
woman came to the house and asked to
see mamma,&mdash;oh, such a dreadful old
woman! She hadn&#8217;t any bonnet or coat
or gloves,&mdash;just a red shawl on her
head, and an old patched dress, and a
gingham apron. And when James and
Elise and everybody told her mamma
was sick, she said she would see her
anyhow. And she did. She pushed her
way upstairs to mamma, and talked awfully,&mdash;said
she was a poor honest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
woman, if she did sell apples on the
corner; and she was raising her grandchild
honest; and she asked how her
Meg came by that ring, and where she
got it. And then mamma, who had
turned pale and fluttery, sent for me;
and I had to tell her all, and she nearly
fainted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; asked Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, because&mdash;because&mdash;I had Meg in
the garden and played with her, and
took her for a real true friend. You see,
she wasn&#8217;t a nice little girl at all,&#8221; said
Miss Polly, impressively. &#8220;Her grandmother
had an apple stand at the street
corner, and her brother cleaned fish on
the wharf, and they lived in an awful
place over a butcher&#8217;s shop; and mamma
said she must not come into our
garden again, and I mustn&#8217;t play with
her or talk to her ever, ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no answer for a moment.
Dan was thinking&mdash;thinking fast. It
seemed time for him to say something,&mdash;to
speak up in his own blunt
way,&mdash;to put himself in his own honest
place. But, with the new charm of this
little lady&#8217;s flattering fancy on him,
Dan&#8217;s courage failed. He felt that to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
acknowledge a bootblack past and a
sausage shop future would be a shock
to Miss Polly that would break off
friendly relations forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you gave up your real true
friend?&#8221; he said a little reproachfully,
and Miss Polly hopped down from her
rock perch and proceeded to make her
way back to the yacht.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had to, you see. Even dad,
who lets me do anything I please, said
I must remember I was a Forester,
and make friends that fitted my name.
And so&mdash;so&#8221; (Miss Polly looked up,
smiling into Dan&#8217;s face) &#8220;I am going to
make friends with you. Dad says he
knows all about St. Andrew&#8217;s College,
and you must be first-class boys if you
belong there; and he is glad of a chance
to give you a little fun. There he is
calling us now!&#8221;&mdash;as a deep voice
shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;All aboard, boys and girls! We&#8217;re
off in an hour! All aboard!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan&mdash;Dan,&#8221; piped Freddy&#8217;s small
voice. &#8220;Jim and Dud are dressing for
the party, Dan. Come, we must dress,
too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>And Dan, feeling like one venturing
into unknown waters, proceeded to
make the best of the things Good
Brother Francis had packed in his small
shabby trunk. There was the suit that
bore the stamp of the English tailor;
there was a pair of low shoes, that
pinched a little in the toes; there was a
spotless shirt and collar outgrown by
some mother&#8217;s darling, and a blue necktie
that was all a necktie should be when,
with Freddy&#8217;s assistance, it was put
properly in place. Really, it was not a
bad-looking boy at all that faced Dan in
the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8217;s&#8221; swinging mirror when
this party toilette was complete.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look fine, Dan!&#8221; said his little
chum, as they took their way down to
the wharf where &#8220;The Polly&#8221; was
awaiting them,&mdash;&#8220;so big and strong&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tough,&#8221; said Dan, concluding the
sentence with a forced laugh. &#8220;Well,
that&#8217;s what I am, kid,&mdash;big and strong
and tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&mdash;Dan, no!&#8221; said Freddy.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not tough at all, and you
mustn&#8217;t say so when you go to a girl&#8217;s
party, Dan.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dan, as he
thought of the violet eyes that would
open in dismay at such a confession.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll play the highflier to-night if I can,
kid; though it&#8217;s a new game with Dan
Dolan, I must say.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with a queer sense of shamming
that he had never felt before, Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s boy started off for Miss Polly&#8217;s
party.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XVII.&mdash;Polly&#8217;s Party.</p>
</div>

<p>To all Miss Polly&#8217;s guests, that evening was
a wonderful experience; but to Dan
it was an entrance into a fairy realm
that his fancy had never pictured; for
in the hard, rough ways his childish feet
had walked neither fairies nor fancies
had place. He had found sailing over
sunlit seas in Killykinick&#8217;s dingy boats
a very pleasant pastime; but the &#8220;Sary
Ann&#8221; seemed to sink into a drifting tub
when he stood on the spotless deck of
&#8220;The Polly&#8221; as she spread her snowy
wings for her homeward flight.</p>
<p>Dad, who, though very rich and great
now, still remembered those &#8220;pirate
days&#8221; when he was young himself,
proved the most charming of hosts. He
took the boys over his beautiful boat,
where every bit of shining brass and
chain and rope and bit of rigging was
in perfect shipshape; and an artful
little motor was hidden away for emergencies
of wind and tide. There was a
lovely little cabin, all in white and gold,
with pale blue draperies; and two tiny
staterooms dainty enough for the slumbers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
of a fairy queen. There were
books and games, and a victrola that
sang full-toned boating songs as they
glided onward.</p>
<p>Even Dud was properly impressed by
the charms of &#8220;The Polly&#8221;; and Jim
was outspoken in his admiration.
Freddy was wide-eyed with delight; and
Dan was swept quite away from his
usual moorings into another world,&mdash;a
world where Aunt Winnie&#8217;s boy seemed
altogether lost. For, with Miss Polly
slipping her little hand in his and guiding
him over her namesake, and Freddy
telling Tad the story of Dan&#8217;s dive
among the sharks, to which even the
man at &#8220;The Polly&#8217;s&#8221; wheel listened
with interest, with dad so jolly and
friendly, and everything so gay and
beautiful around him, it was no wonder
that Dan&#8217;s head, accustomed to sober
prosy ways, began to turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolan,&mdash;Dolan? I ought to know
that name,&#8221; said dad, as, with Polly
and her &#8220;nice&#8221; boy at his side, he stood
watching the roofs and spires of Beach
Cliff come into view. &#8220;There was a Phil
Dolan in my class at Harvard,&mdash;one of
the finest fellows I ever knew; rolling in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
money, but it didn&#8217;t hurt him. He is a
judge now, and I think he had a brother
at West Point. Are you related to
them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sir,&#8221; answered Dan, who at
another time would have blurted out
that he was not of the Harvard or West
Point kind. &#8220;I&mdash;I am from Maryland.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Maryland!&#8221; said dad, approvingly.
&#8220;I see,&mdash;I see! The Dolans of
Maryland. I&#8217;ve heard of them,&mdash;one of
the old Catholic families, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we&#8217;re&mdash;we&#8217;re Catholics all
right,&#8221; said Dan, catching to this saving
spar of truth, in his doubt and uncertainty.
&#8220;We&mdash;we wouldn&#8217;t be anything
else if we were killed for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you wouldn&#8217;t. That is your
heritage, my boy! Hold fast to it,&#8221; said
dad, heartily. Then he turned about to
see that &#8220;The Polly&#8221; made the way
safely to her private wharf, feeling that
he left his little girl with the scion of a
family quite equal to the Foresters.</p>
<p>With the strange sense of treading in
an unreal world, Dan passed on with
the rest of the chattering, laughing
crowd to the pretty, rustic wharf
jutting out into the waters, and up to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
the steep, narrow street where carriages
were waiting to take them to the Forester
home. The wide grounds and
gardens were already gay with the
gathering guests. Pretty, flower-decked
tables were set in the maze. The trees
were hung with Japanese lanterns, that
a little later would glow into jewelled
lights. There was a group of &#8220;grown-ups&#8221;
on the porch,&mdash;mamma, beautiful
in cloudy white; sisters and cousins and
aunts,&mdash;for the Forester family was a
large one. There were two grandmothers&mdash;one
fat and one thin,&mdash;very
elegant old ladies, with white hair rolled
high upon their heads. They looked
upon the youthful guests, through gold
lorgnettes, and were really most awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>The St. Andrew&#8217;s boys were brought
up and &#8220;presented&#8221; in due form. It was
an ordeal. How Dan got through with
it he didn&#8217;t know. He had never before
been &#8220;presented&#8221; to any one but Polly.
But dad managed it somehow, and on
the porch friendly shadows were gathering
that concealed any social discrepancies.
Then Polly flitted off to don
her party dress, and Dan found himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
stranded on the danger reefs of this
strange world, with dad giving the fat
grandmother his family history.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dolan?&#8221; repeated the old lady, who
was a little deaf. &#8220;One of the Dolans of
Maryland, you say, Pemberton? Dear
me! I used to visit Dolan Hall when I
was a girl. Such a beautiful old Colonial
home! Is it still standing?&#8221; she
said, turning to Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; stammered
Dan, who found the gleam of the
gold lorgnettes most confusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does he say?&#8221; asked the old
lady sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;That he does not know, mother
dear!&#8221; answered dad.</p>
<p>&#8220;He should know,&#8221; said the old lady,
severely. &#8220;The young people are growing
up in these careless days without
any proper sentiment to the past. A
home like Dolan Hall, with its memories
and traditions, should be a pride to all
of the Dolan blood. The name is really
French&mdash;D&#8217;Olane,&mdash;but most unfortunately,
as I consider, was anglicized.
The family was originally from Touraine,
and dates back to the Crusaders,
and is most aristocratic.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He looks it,&#8221; murmured the thin
grandmother, fixing her lorgnettes on
Dan&#8217;s broad shoulders as he moved
away to join Tad and Freddy, who were
making friends with Polly&#8217;s poodle.
&#8220;I have never seen a boy carry himself
better. Blood will tell, as I have always
insisted, Stella.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lady at her side laughed. She,
too, had been regarding Dan with
curious interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it tell, Aunt Lena?&#8221; she
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The lady and the gentleman,&#8221;
answered Polly&#8217;s grandmother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, does it?&#8221; said the other, softly.
&#8220;I suppose I am not very wise in such
matters, but one of the nicest ladies I
ever knew was a little Irish sewing
woman who made buttonholes. It was
one summer when I went South, more
years ago than I care to count; and
Winnie&mdash;her name was Winnie&mdash;came
to the house to renovate my riding habit
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker paused as if she did not
care to say more. She was a slender
little person, not awe-inspiring at all.
She had just driven up in a pretty, light
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
carriage, and was still muffled in a soft
fleecy wrap that fell around her like a
cloud. The face that looked out from it
was sweet and pale as a star. It brightened
into radiance as Polly, a veritable
fairy now in her party fluffs and ruffs
and ribbons, sprang out on the porch
and flung herself into Miss Stella&#8217;s
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marraine! Marraine!&#8221; she cried
rapturously,&mdash;&#8220;my own darling Marraine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why will you let the child give you
that ridiculous name, my dear?&#8221; protested
grandmamma, disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because&mdash;because I have the right
to it,&#8221; laughed the lady, as Polly nestled
close to her side. &#8220;I am her godmother
real and true,&mdash;am I not, Polykins?
And we like the pretty French name
for it better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, much better!&#8221; assented Polly.
&#8220;&#8216;Godmother&#8217; is too old and solemn to
suit Marraine. Oh!&#8221; (with another rapturous
hug) &#8220;it was so good of you to
come all the way from Newport just for
my party, dear, dear Marraine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All the way from Newport!&#8221; answered
the lady. &#8220;Why, that dear letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
you sent would have brought me from
the moon. You will be ten years old to-night,
it said,&mdash;ten years old! O Pollykins!
Pollykins!&#8221; (There was a little
tremor in the voice.) &#8220;And you asked if
I could come and help you with your
party. I could and I would, so here I am!
And here is your birthday present.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marraine flung a slender golden chain
around Polly&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you darling,&mdash;you darling!&#8221;
murmured Polly. &#8220;But <i>you</i> are the best
of all birthday presents, Marraine,&mdash;the
very best of all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, really we must stop all this
&#8216;spooning,&#8217; Pollykins, and start things,&#8221;
said Marraine, dropping her, and emerging
in a shining silvery robe, with a
big bunch of starry jessamine pinned
on her breast.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not going to bother with the
children, surely, Stella?&#8221; said dad, who
had drawn near the speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; said the lady, flashing him a
laughing look. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I came for.
I am going to forget the years (don&#8217;t
be cruel enough to count them, Cousin
Pen), and for two hours (is it only two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
hours we have, Pollykins?) be a little
girl again to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, taking Polly&#8217;s hand, she tripped
away from the grown-ups on the porch,
and things were started indeed.</p>
<p>Grove and garden, maze and lawn,
suddenly sparkled with jewelled lights;
the stringed band in the pagoda burst
into gay music. Led by a silvery vision,
Polly&#8217;s guests formed a great ring-around-a-rosy
for an opening measure,
and the party began. And, with a fairy
godmother like Miss Stella leading the
fun, it was a party to be remembered.
There were marches and games, there
was blind man&#8217;s buff through the jewel-lit
maze, there was a Virginia reel to
music gay enough to make a hundred-year-old
tortoise dance. There was the
Jack Horner pie, fully six feet round,
and fringed with gay ribbons to pull out
the plums. Wonderful plums they were.
Minna Foster drew a silver belt buckle;
her little sister, a blue locket; Dud, a
scarf-pin; Jim, a pocketknife with
enough blades and &#8220;fixings&#8221; to fill a
miniature tool chest; and Freddy, a
paint box quite as complete; while Dan
pulled out the biggest plum of all&mdash;a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
round white box with a silver cord.</p>
<p>As it came out at the end of his red
ribbon, there was a moment&#8217;s breathless
hush, broken by Polly&#8217;s glad cry:</p>
<p>&#8220;The prize,&mdash;the prize, Marraine!
Dan has drawn my birthday prize!&#8221;
And, under a battery of curious and
envious eyes, Dan opened the box to find
within a pretty gold watch, ticking a
most cheering greeting to its new
owner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan,&mdash;Dan!&#8221; Polly&#8217;s jubilant voice
rose over all the chorus around him.
&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you got it, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Marraine&#8217;s eyes followed Polly&#8217;s
delighted glance with the same look of
curious interest that she had bent upon
Dan a while ago on the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that this is for me?&#8221;
he blurted out, in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, for you,&mdash;for <i>you</i>,&#8221; repeated
Polly in high glee. &#8220;It&#8217;s real gold and
keeps real time, and it&#8217;s yours forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too&mdash;too much&mdash;I mean it&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s
too fine for a fellow like me,&#8221; stammered
Dan. &#8220;What will I do with it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wear it,&#8221; chirped Miss Polly, throwing
the silken guard around his neck, &#8220;so
you will never forget my birthday, Dan.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>And then a big Japanese gong sounded
the call to the flower-decked tables,
where busy waiters were soon serving
a veritable fairy feast. There were
cakes of table-size and shape and color;
little baskets and boxes full of wonderful
bonbons; nuts sugared and glazed
until they did not seem nuts at all; ice-cream
birds in nests of spun sugar;
&#8220;kisses&#8221; that snapped into hats and
wreaths and caps. And all the while
the band played, and the jewelled lights
twinkled, and the stars shone far away
above the arching trees. And Dan, with
his watch around his neck, held his
place as the winner of the prize at Miss
Polly&#8217;s side, feeling as if he were in
some dizzy dream. Then there were
more games, and a grand hide-and-seek,
in which dad and some of the grown-ups
joined.</p>
<p>Dan had found an especially fine
place under the gnarled boughs of an old
cedar tree, that would have held its
head high in the starlight if some of
dad&#8217;s gardeners had not twisted it out
of growth and shape. Hiding under
the crooked shadows, Dan was listening
to the merry shouts through maze and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
garden, when he became suddenly conscious
of a change in their tone. The
voices grew sharp, shrill, excited, and
then little Polly burst impetuously into
his hiding place,&mdash;a sobbing, trembling,
indignant little Polly, followed by a
score of breathless young guests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it!&#8221; she was crying
tempestuously. &#8220;I <i>won&#8217;t</i> believe it! You&#8217;re
just telling horrid stories on Dan, because
I like him and he got the prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Pollykins! Pollykins!&#8221; came Miss
Stella&#8217;s low, chiding voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Halloo! halloo! What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221;
rose dad&#8217;s deep tones above the clamor.
&#8220;My little girl crying,&mdash;crying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am!&#8221; was the sobbing answer.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t help it, dad. The girls are all
whispering mean, horrid stories about
Dan, and I made them tell me all they
said they had heard. I don&#8217;t believe
them, and I <i>won&#8217;t</i> believe them! I told
them I wouldn&#8217;t believe them,&mdash;that I
would come right to Dan and let him
speak for himself.&mdash;Were you ever a
newsboy and a beggar boy, Dan? Did&mdash;did
you ever black boots? Have you an
aunt in the poorhouse, as Minna Foster
says?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XVIII.&mdash;Back Into Line.</p>
</div>

<p>There was a moment&#8217;s pause. Dan was
really too bewildered to speak. He felt
he was reeling down from the rainbow
heights to which Miss Polly had led
him, and the shock took away his breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all&mdash;all a horrid story; I&#8217;m sure
it is,&mdash;isn&#8217;t it, Dan?&#8221; pleaded his little
friend, tremulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, no!&#8221; said Dan, rallying to his
simple, honest self again. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t a
story at all. I <i>was</i> a newsboy, I <i>did</i>
shine boots at the street corner, and
Aunt Winnie <i>is</i> with the Little Sisters
of the Poor now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bravo!&mdash;bravo!&#8221; came a low silvery
voice from the shadows, and Miss Stella
clapped her slender hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, Dan!&#8221; cried poor little Miss
Polly, sobbing outright. &#8220;A newsboy
and bootblack! Oh, how could you
fool me so, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With your infernal lies about your
home and family!&#8221; burst forth dad, in
sudden wrath at Polly&#8217;s tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fool,&mdash;I didn&#8217;t lie, sir!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
blurted out Dan, fiercely. &#8220;I did nothing
of the kind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will kindly do the boy justice
to remember, he did <i>not</i>, Cousin Pem!&#8221;
and Miss Stella&#8217;s clear, sweet voice rose
in witness. &#8220;You gave his family history
yourself. He did not know what
you were talking about, with your Crusading
ancestors and the D&#8217;Olanes. I
could see it in his face. You are all
blood-blind up here, Cousin Pem. I was
laughing to myself all the time, for I
guessed who Dan Dolan was. I knew he
was at St. Andrew&#8217;s. His dear old Aunt
Winnie is one of my truest friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Marraine, Marraine!&#8221; murmured
Polly, eagerly. &#8220;And&mdash;and you don&#8217;t
mind it if&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she is with the Little Sisters of
the Poor, Pollykins? Not a bit! Some
day I may be there myself. Now that
this tempest in a teapot is over, you can
all go off and finish your games. I am
going to sit under this nice old tree and
talk to Miss Winnie&#8217;s boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while dad, still a little hot at the
trouble that had marred Polly&#8217;s party,
started the fun in another direction,
Miss Stella gathered her silvery gown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
around her and sat down on the rustic
bench beneath the old cedar, and talked
to Dan. He learned how Aunt Winnie
had sewed patiently and skilfully for
this lovely lady a dozen years ago, when
she was spending a gay season in his
own town; and how the gentle old
seamstress, with her simple faith and
tender sympathy, her wise warnings to
the gay, motherless girl, had won a
place in her heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to coax her home with me,&#8221;
said Miss Stella, &#8220;to make it &#8216;home,&#8217; as
I felt she could; but Baby Danny was
in the way,&mdash;the little Danny that she
could not leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Dan, in his turn, told about
Killykinick, and how he had been sent
there for the summer and had met little
Polly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should have told,&#8221; he said, lifting
Aunt Winnie&#8217;s own blue Irish eyes to
Miss Stella&#8217;s face,&mdash;&#8220;I should have said
right out straight and square that I
wasn&#8217;t Polly&#8217;s kind, and had no right to
push in here with grand folks like hers.
But it was all so fine it sort of turned
my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do that,&#8221; replied Miss Stella,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
softly. &#8220;It has turned mine often,
Danny. But now we both see straight
and clear again, and I am going to make
things straight and clear with all the
others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dan,&mdash;&#8220;not with
those grand ladies in gold spectacles;
not with Polly&#8217;s dad; maybe not with
Polly herself. I&#8217;m all mixed up, and out
of line with them. And&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; (Dan
took the silken guard from his neck) &#8220;I
want you to give them back this gold
watch, and tell them so.&#8221; (He slipped
the Jack Horner prize into Miss Stella&#8217;s
hand.) &#8220;I&#8217;m not asking anything and
I&#8217;m not taking anything that comes to
me like this. And&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221; (he rose
and stood under the crooked tree in all
his straight, sturdy strength) &#8220;Neb is
down at the wharf with a load of clams.
We passed him as we came up. I&#8217;m not
pushing in among the silk cushions any
more. I&#8217;m going home with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which, with Miss Stella&#8217;s sympathetic
approval, he did at once.</p>
<p>When a little later the guests had all
gone, and &#8220;The Polly&#8221; was taking her
white-winged way back to Killykinick
with Dud, Jim, and Freddy; when the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
jewelled lights had gone out, and the
party was over, and all was quiet on the
starlit porch, Miss Stella returned Dan&#8217;s
watch and gave his message. Even the
two grandmammas, being really grandmammas
at heart, softened to it, and
dad declared gruffly it had been a fool
business altogether, while Polly flung
herself sobbing into her godmother&#8217;s
arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan,&mdash;poor Dan! He is the nicest
boy I ever saw,&mdash;the nicest and the
kindest, Marraine! And now&mdash;now he
will never come back here any more!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he will, Pollykins,&#8221; was
the low answer. &#8220;You see&#8221; (Marraine
dropped a light kiss on the nestling
curls), &#8220;he was a newsboy and a bootblack,
and he does not deny it; while
you&mdash;you, Pollykins&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care, what he was!&#8221; interrupted
Miss Polly, tempestuously,&mdash;&#8220;I
don&#8217;t care what he was. I took him
for my real true friend, and I am not
going to give up Dan as I gave up Meg
Murray, Marraine.&#8221; Polly tightened her
clasp around Miss Stella&#8217;s neck so she
could whisper softly in her ear: &#8220;If he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
won&#8217;t come back, you and I will go after
him; won&#8217;t we, Marraine?&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with his head pillowed on
a pile of fish nets&mdash;very different, we
must confess, from the silken cushions
of dad&#8217;s pretty yacht,&mdash;and with old
Neb drowsily watching her ragged sail,
Dan was back again in his own line, beneath
the guiding stars. It was a calm,
beautiful night, and those stars were at
their brightest. Even Neb&#8217;s dull wits
seemed to kindle under their radiance.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can steer &#8217;most anywhere when
they shine like that. Don&#8217;t want none
of these &#8217;ere winking, blinking lights to
show you the way,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the trouble is they don&#8217;t always
shine,&#8221; answered Dan.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Neb, slowly, &#8220;they don&#8217;t;
that&#8217;s a fact. But they ain&#8217;t ever really
out, like menfolk&#8217;s lights. The stars is
always thar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always there,&#8221;&mdash;yes, Dan realized,
as, with his head on the dank, fishy
pillow, he looked up in the glory above
him, the stars were always there.
Blurred sometimes by earthly mists and
vapors, lost in the dazzling gleam of
jewelled lights, darkened by the shadows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
of crooked trees, they shone with
pure, steadfast, guiding rays,&mdash;the stars
that were always there. A witching
little Will-o&#8217;-the-wisp had bewildered
Dan into strange ways this evening; but
he was back again in his own straight
honest line beneath the stars.</p>
<p>On &#8220;The Polly,&#8221; making her way over
the starlit water to Killykinick, things
were not so pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a mean, dirty trick to give
Dan away. I don&#8217;t care who did it!&#8221;
said big-hearted Jim, roused into spirit
and speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t I,&mdash;oh, indeed it wasn&#8217;t
I!&#8221; declared Freddy. &#8220;I told Tad Dan
was the biggest, strongest, finest fellow
in the whole bunch. I never said a word
about his being a newsboy or a bootblack,
though I don&#8217;t think it hurts him
a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it doesn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Jim, whose
blood had been a &#8220;true blue&#8221; stream before
the Stars and Stripes began to
wave. &#8220;But there are some folks that
think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calling me fool, are you?&#8221; said Dud,
fiercely.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; retorted Jim. &#8220;But if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
the name fits you, take it. I don&#8217;t object.&#8221;
And he turned away, with a flash
in his eyes most unusual for Sunny
Jim,&mdash;a flash that Dud did not venture
to kindle into angry fire.</p>
<p>But, though the storm blew over, as
such springtime storms will, Dan had
learned a lesson, and felt that he never
again wished to venture on the dizzy
heights where wise heads turn and
strong feet falter. Though Dud and
Jim, who both had pocket money in
plenty, made arrangements at the Boat
Club for the use of a little motor boat
several times a week, Dan held his own
line as second mate at Killykinick, and
was contented to share old Neb&#8217;s voyaging.
They went out often now; for,
under the old sailor&#8217;s guidance, Dan
was becoming an expert fisherman. And
soon the dingy boat, loaded with its
silvery spoil, became known to camps
and cottages along the other shores.
Poor old Neb was too dull-witted for
business; but customers far from
markets watched eagerly for the merry
blue-eyed boy who brought fish, &#8220;still
kicking,&#8221; for their early breakfast,&mdash;clams,
chaps, and lobsters, whose freshness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
was beyond dispute. Neb&#8217;s old
leather wallet began to fill up as it had
never been filled before. And the dinners
that were served on the &#8220;Lady
Jane,&#8221; the broiled, the baked, the fried
fish dished up in rich plenty every day,
shook Brother Bart&#8217;s allegiance to Irish
stews, and, as he declared, &#8220;would make
it aisy for a heretic to keep the Friday
fast forever.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, Dan had the garden to dig and
weed, the cow to milk, the chickens to
feed,&mdash;altogether, the days were most
busy and pleasant; and it was a happy,
if tired, boy that tumbled at night into
his hammock swung beneath the stars,
while old Jeb and Neb smoked their
pipes on the deck beside him.</p>
<p>Three letters had come from Aunt
Winnie,&mdash;a Government boat brought
weekly mail to the lighthouse on Numskull
Nob. They were prim little letters,
carefully margined and written, and
spelled as the good Sisters had taught
her in early youth. She took her pen in
hand&mdash;so letters had always begun in
Aunt Winnie&#8217;s schooldays&mdash;to write him
a few lines. She was in good health and
hoped he was the same, though many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
were sick at the Home, and Mrs. McGraw
(whom Dan recalled as the dozing
lady of his visit) had died very
sudden on Tuesday; but she had a priest
at the last, and a Requiem Mass in the
chapel, with the altar in black, and
everything most beautiful. Poor Miss
Flannery&#8217;s cough was bad, and she
wouldn&#8217;t be long here, either; but, as
the good Mother says, we are blessed
in having a holy place where we can
die in peace and quiet. And Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s own leg was bad still, but she
thanked God she could get around a bit
and help the others. And, though she
might never see him again&mdash;for she
would be turned on seventy next Thursday,&mdash;she
prayed for her dear boy
nights, and dreamed of him constant.
And, begging God to bless him and keep
him from harm, she was his affectionate
aunt, Winnie Curley.&#8217;</p>
<p>The other letters were very much in
the same tone: some other old lady was
dying or failing fast; for, with all its
twilight peace, Aunt Winnie was in a
valley of the shadow, where the light of
youth and hope and cheer that whistling,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
laughing Dan brought into Mulligans&#8217;
attic could not shine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get her home,&#8221; resolved
Dan, who was keen enough to read this
loss and longing between the old-fashioned
neatly-written lines. &#8220;It&#8217;s
Pete Patterson and the meat shop for
me in the fall and good-bye to St. Andrew&#8217;s
and &#8216;pipe dreams&#8217; forever! Aunt
Winnie has to come back, with her blue
teapot on her own stove and Tabby purring
at her feet again or&mdash;or&#8221; (Dan
choked at the thought) &#8220;they&#8217;ll be having
a funeral Mass at the Little Sisters
for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Dan lay awake a long time that
night looking at the stars, and stifling a
dull pang in his young heart that the
heights of which he had dreamed were
not for him. But he was up betimes next
morning, his own sturdy self again. Old
Neb had a bad attack of rheumatism
that made his usual early trip impossible.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will be looking for us,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;I promised those college girls
camping at Shelter Cove to bring them
fresh fish for breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let them catch for themselves!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
growled old Neb, who was rubbing his
stiffened arm with whale oil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; said Dan in boyish scorn.
&#8220;What do girls know about fishing?
They squeal every time they get a bite.
I&#8217;ll take Freddy to watch the lines
(Brother Bart isn&#8217;t so scary about him
now), and go myself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XIX.&mdash;A Morning Venture.</p>
</div>

<p>After some persuasion from Captain
Jeb, who declared he could trust matey
Dan&#8217;s navigation now against any wind
and tide, Brother Bart consented to
Freddy&#8217;s morning sail with his sturdy
chum.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure I know Dan loves laddie better
than his own life,&#8221; said the good old
man anxiously, as he watched Neb&#8217;s
ragged sail flitting off with the two
young fishermen. &#8220;But it&#8217;s only a boy
he is, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebby,&#8221; said Captain Jeb, briefly.
&#8220;But thar&#8217;s boys wuth half a dozen
good-sized men, and matey is that kind.
You needn&#8217;t scare about any little chap
that ships with him. And what&#8217;s to hurt
him, anyhow, Padre? You&#8217;ve got to let
all young critters try their legs and
wings.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Freddy was trying his triumphantly
this morning. It was one of
Dan&#8217;s lucky days, and the lines were
drawn in again and again, until the
college girls&#8217; breakfast and many more
silvery shiners were fluttering and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
gasping in old Neb&#8217;s fish basket. Then
Dan proceeded to deliver his wares at
neighborly island shores, where summer
campers were taking brief holidays.
Some of these islands, more sheltered
than Killykinick, were fringed with a
thick growth of hardy evergreens, hollowed
into coves and inlets, where the
waves, broken in their wild, free sweep,
lapped low-shelving shores and invited
gentle adventure.</p>
<p>On one of these pleasant outposts
was the college camp; and half a dozen
pretty girl graduates, in &#8220;middies&#8221; and
khaki skirts, came down to meet Dan.
One of them led a big, tawny dog, who
made a sudden break for the boat,
nearly overturning Freddy in his leap,
and crouching by Dan&#8217;s side, whining
and shivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s yours! We said he was
yours!&#8221; went up the girlish chorus.
&#8220;Then take him away, please. And don&#8217;t
let him come back; for he howled all
night, and nearly set us crazy. Nellie
Morris says dogs never howl that way
unless somebody is dead or dying; and
she left her mother sick, and is almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
frantic. Please take him away, and
don&#8217;t ever bring him near us again!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but he isn&#8217;t mine at all,&#8221; replied
Dan, staring at the big dog, who,
shivering and wretched as he seemed,
awoke some vague memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then whose is he?&#8221; asked a pretty
spokesman, severely. &#8220;He could not
have dropped from the clouds, and
yours was the only boat that came here
yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know,&mdash;I know, Dan!&#8221; broke
in Freddy, eagerly. &#8220;He belongs to that
big man who came with us on the steamboat.
He had two dogs in leashes, and
this is one of them, I know, because I
saw his brown spot on his head when I
gave him a cracker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Wirt?&#8221; Dan&#8217;s vague memory
leaped into vivid light: Mr. John Wirt&#8217;s
big, tawny dog indeed, who perhaps,
with some dim dog-sense, remembered
Freddy. &#8220;I do know him now,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;He belongs to a gentleman
named Wirt&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, take him where he belongs,&#8221;
interrupted the young lady. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
care where it is. We simply can&#8217;t have
him howling here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, take him, Dan!&#8221; said Freddy.
&#8220;Let us take him home with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Wirt must be around somewhere,&#8221;
reflected Dan. &#8220;He said perhaps
he would come to Killykinick.
We&#8217;ll take him,&#8221; he agreed cheerfully,
as he handed out his basket of fish to
the pretty, young campers. &#8220;And I
think his master will come along to look
him up.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the boys started on their homeward
way, with Rex (which was the
name on their new companion&#8217;s collar)
seated between them, still restless and
quivering, in spite of all Freddy&#8217;s
efforts to make friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t this way on the boat,&#8221;
said Freddy as, after all his stroking
and soothing, Rex only lifted his head
and emitted a long, mournful howl. &#8220;I
went down on the lower deck where the
big man had left his dogs, and they
played with me fine,&mdash;shook paws and
wagged their tails and were real nice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he knows he is lost and
wants to get back to his master,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;Dogs have a lot of sense generally,
so what took him over to that
girls&#8217; camp puzzles me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t like the girls,&mdash;did you,
Rex?&#8221; asked Freddy, as he patted his
new friend&#8217;s nose. &#8220;My, he is a
beauty,&mdash;isn&#8217;t he, Dan? Just the kind
of a dog I&#8217;d like to have; and, if nobody
comes for him, he will be ours for keeps.
Do you think Brother Andrew will let
us have him out in the stable at St.
Andrew&#8217;s? Dick Walton kept his
rabbits there&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Until a weasel came and gobbled
them up,&#8221; laughed Dan, as he steered
away from a line of rocks that jutted
out like sharp teeth from a low-lying,
heavily wooded shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;They couldn&#8217;t gobble Rex,&mdash;could
they, old fellow!&#8221; said Freddy, with
another friendly pat.</p>
<p>But, regardless of all these kindly
overtures, Rex sprang to his feet,
barked in wild excitement for a moment,
made a plunge from the boat and
struck out for shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s gone,&mdash;he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; cried
Freddy, desperately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rex! Rex!&#8221; called Dan. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nothing or nobody there. Come back,&mdash;come
back! Well, he must be a durned
fool of a dog to be jumping off at every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
island he sees.&mdash;Rex! Rex!&mdash;He&#8217;ll
starve to death if we leave him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he will,&mdash;he will!&#8221; said Freddy,
wofully. &#8220;Come back, Rex, old fellow,
nice dog,&mdash;come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>Freddy whistled and called in vain:
Rex had vanished into the thick undergrowth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s go for him,&mdash;let&#8217;s go for
him, Dan!&#8221; pleaded Freddy. &#8220;Maybe he
is after a wild duck or something. We
ought not to let a fine dog like that get
lost and starve to death. One of the
deck hands on the steamboat told me
those dogs were worth a hundred dollars
a piece, and that they had more
sense than some humans.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he isn&#8217;t showing it this morning,
sure; and he didn&#8217;t yesterday
either,&#8221; said Dan, gruffly. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t the
kind of dog to leave around here for any
tramp to pick up, I&#8217;ll agree; but how
are we to haul him back, unless he
chooses to come? And I know nothing
about this shore, anyhow. Neb told me
they called it Last Island, and there was
once a light here that the old whalers
could see fifty miles out&mdash;why, halloo!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Dan paused in his survey of the doubtful
situation. &#8220;He&#8217;s coming back!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rex! Rex!&#8221; shouted Freddy, gleefully;
for it was Rex indeed,&mdash;Rex
coming through the dense low growth,
in long leaps, with quick, sharp barks
that were like calls; Rex plunging into
the water and swimming with swift
strokes to the waiting boat; but Rex
refusing absolutely to be pulled aboard.
He only splashed and shook himself,
scattering a very geyser of salt water
on the tugging boys, and barked louder
and sharper still as if he were doing his
best to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jing!&#8221; exclaimed Dan, giving up all
efforts to manage him. &#8220;I never saw
such a durned chump of a dog! I&#8217;m wet
to the skin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he wants something!&#8221; said
softer-hearted Freddy. &#8220;He is trying to
tell us something, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rex barked again, as if he had heard
the words; and, leaping on the edge of
the boat, he caught Freddy&#8217;s khaki
sleeve.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lookout there, or he&#8217;ll pull you overboard!&#8221;
shouted Dan in fierce alarm, as
Rex pulled still harder. &#8220;Golly! I believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
he wants us to come ashore with
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he does,&mdash;he does!&#8221; said Freddy,
eagerly. &#8220;He has hunted something
down and wants us to get it, Dan. Let
us see what it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a temptation that two live boys
could not resist. Mooring Neb&#8217;s old
fishing boat to a sharp projecting rock,
they proceeded to wade where it would
have been impossible to navigate; Rex
leaping before them, barking jubilantly
now, as if he had won his point.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stand back, kid!&#8221; (Through all
the excitement of a discoverer, Dan did
not lose sight of his responsibilities.)
&#8220;Let me go ahead, so if there is anything
to hurt I&#8217;ll strike it first. Straight
behind in my steps, and lookout for
suck-holes!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with Rex leading, they proceeded
Indian file over the narrow strip
of sand that shelved to the sea, and then
on through thicket and branches that
hedged the shore in wild, luxuriant
growth, until suddenly the ruins of the
old lighthouse rose out of the tangle before
them. The shaft that had upheld
the beacon light was all gone save the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
iron framework, which rose bare and
rusted above the little stone cabin that
had sheltered the keeper of long ago,
and that still stood amid crumbling
stones and fallen timbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back, Freddy,&mdash;back!&#8221; shouted Dan,
as something big and fierce bolted out of
the ruins. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s the other dog!&#8221;
he added in relief. &#8220;Mr. Wirt <i>must</i> be
somewhere around.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, peering into the open door of
the cabin, he stood dumb with dismay;
for there indeed, stretched upon the
rotten floor under the broken roof, was
his friend of the steamboat. His gun
was beside him, his head pillowed on
his knapsack, his eyes closed, all his
pride and strength and manly bearing
gone; only the short, hard breathing
showed that he was still alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Golly!&#8221; gasped Freddy, who had
crept in behind his chum. &#8220;Is&mdash;is he
dead, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not&mdash;not&mdash;yet, but he looks mighty
close to it. Mr. Wirt&mdash;&#8221; he faltered,
bending over the prostrate form; &#8220;Mr.
Wirt!&#8221; he repeated louder. There was
no answer. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;s gone,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Dan, in an awe-struck voice; and
Freddy burst into boyish tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you crying about?&#8221; asked
Dan, gruffly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&mdash;I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;
was the trembling answer. &#8220;I&mdash;I never
saw anybody dead before. What&mdash;what
do you think killed him, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing. He isn&#8217;t killed,&#8221; replied
Dan, who had been taking close observations.
&#8220;He is still breathing. I guess
he came here to hunt and got sick, and
that&#8217;s what the dog was trying to tell
people. Gosh, it&#8217;s a pity dogs like that
can&#8217;t talk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is,&mdash;it is!&#8221; murmured Freddy,
putting his arm around Rex, who, his
duty done, was seated on his hind legs,
gravely surveying his master.</p>
<p>The sick man moved a little, and
groaned feebly: &#8220;Water!&#8221; the word
came faintly through parched lips.
&#8220;Water,&mdash;a little&mdash;Water!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan picked up a can that had evidently
done duty before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay by him, Freddy, so he&#8217;ll know
there is something here. I&#8217;ll go to get
some water. They must have had a
pump or well around a place like this,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>And while Dan discovered the broken,
half-choked cistern at the back of the
Old Light, Freddy watched the sick
man. He had never before seen any one
very sick, and it took some pluck to keep
his post especially when Mr. Wirt suddenly
opened his eyes and looked at him.
It was such a strange, wild, questioning
look that Freddy felt his heart nearly
leap into his throat.</p>
<p>Then Dan came back with the can
full of water, and together they did
their best for their patient,&mdash;bathing
his head, wetting his parched lips, laving
the helpless hands that were burning
with fever, until the bright, sunken
eyes closed and the sick man sank into
a fitful sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is pretty badly off,&#8221; said Dan,
who had seen pain and sickness and
death, and knew. &#8220;He ought to have a
doctor right away, and it&#8217;s for us to get
one quick as we can. But it will be a
good three hour&#8217;s job; and&#8221; (Aunt Winnie&#8217;s
boy&#8217;s voice softened) &#8220;I hate to
leave the poor fellow here without any
one to give him a drop of water, when
he&#8217;s burning up like this. But you can&#8217;t
sail the boat alone, kid.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t,&#8221; faltered Freddy,&mdash;&#8220;I
can&#8217;t sail the boat, Dan; but&mdash;but&#8221; (the
young voice steadied bravely) &#8220;I can
stay here with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can!&#8221; echoed Dan, staring at
his little chum in amazement. &#8220;You&#8217;d
scare to death, kid, here all alone with a
dying man. He is likely to go off any
minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; faltered Freddy. &#8220;But&mdash;but
I&#8217;d stay by him all the same, Dan.
I can bathe his head and his hands, and
give him water to drink, and say prayers
like Brother Bart says we must
when people are dying. O Dan, we can&#8217;t
leave him here to die alone!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Dan, heartily.
&#8220;I&#8217;d never think of asking a kid like you
to stay. But, with the two dogs on the
watch, there&#8217;s nothing to fear. And you
are doing the real right and plucky
thing, for sure. I&#8217;ll sail over to Killykinick
and see if I can get Jim or Dud
off for the nearest doctor, and be back
here as quick as I can. And you, kid&#8221;
(Dan&#8217;s tone softened tenderly to his
little chum), &#8220;don&#8217;t scare more than
you can help. Stick it out here as best
you can.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>Dan was off at the words, and for a
moment Freddy felt his heart sink within
him. He looked at the broken walls,
the gaping roof, the dying man, and his
blood chilled at the thought of the long
hours before any one could return to
him. Standing at the door of the Old
Light, his eyes followed Dan&#8217;s sturdy
figure leaping swiftly through the
bramble bush, and now he had reached
the boat and put off.</p>
<p>Freddy was left indeed. He gulped
down a big lump that rose in his throat,
and, with the can of water Dan had
freshly filled for him, took his seat at
his patient&#8217;s side. Rex came up and
put a cold nose on his knee, and Freddy&#8217;s
watch began.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XX.&mdash;Little Boy Blue.</p>
</div>

<p>Mr. Wirt lay very still. Freddy never
remembered seeing any one quite so still
before. Even his breathing had grown
quiet, and the rise and fall of the broad
breast was the only sign of life in the
otherwise motionless figure. All around
him was very still, too. Freddy could
hear the plash of the waves on the
beach, the rustle of the wind through
the dwarf trees, the whir of wings as
some sea bird took its swift flight above
the broken roof. But within there was
a solemn hush, that to the small watcher
seemed quite appalling.</p>
<p>Roy, as the other dog was named on
his collar, dozed at his master&#8217;s feet.
Rex kept his place at Freddy&#8217;s side, as
if conscious of his responsibilities; and
for a time that seemed quite interminable,
all were silent. Freddy found himself
studying the big man&#8217;s pale face
with fearsome interest. How very pale
it was! And the rough growth of beard
that hid mouth and chin made it
seem paler still. But the nose was
straight and smooth as Freddy&#8217;s own.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
The silver-streaked hair fell in soft
waves over a broad handsome brow.
And there was a white scar on the left
temple, that throbbed with the low
breathing. Somehow, that scar held
Freddy&#8217;s eye. Surely he had seen a V
shaped scar like it before, where or
when he could not think; perhaps on
one of the big football players at St.
Andrew&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, if good Brother Tim were only
here now!&#8221; thought Freddy hopelessly,
as the picture of the spotless stretch of
infirmary arose before him. The rows of
white beds so safe and soft; the kind
old face bending over the fevered
pillows; Old Top waving his friendly
shadow in the sunlit window; the Angelus
chiming from the great bell
tower; the merry shouts of the ball
players on the green below,&mdash;all these
memories were in dire contrast indeed
to the present scene.</p>
<p>If Dan would only come back! But he
wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;he couldn&#8217;t&mdash;for hours. And
maybe this big, strange man might die
while he was gone,&mdash;die with only a
little boy beside him,&mdash;a little boy to
help him, to pray for him. Freddy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
thoughts grew more and more solemn
and awesome. People always prayed by
dying beds, he knew. Oh, if Dan would
only come with a doctor and perhaps a
priest! For Freddy felt that big men
who wandered around the world with
dogs and guns were likely to need
higher spiritual ministrations than a
small boy could give. In the meanwhile
he would do his best; and, drawing out
his silver-mounted rosary, he began to
say his beads.</p>
<p>And perhaps, as the young watcher
had been an early riser this morning, he
was nodding a little over his decades
when a sudden movement of his patient
roused him. Mr. Wirt was awake, his
eyes fixed steadily on Freddy&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Still here,&#8221; he murmured,&mdash;&#8220;still
here? Boy,&mdash;little boy! Are you real or
a death dream?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a startling question; but
Freddy had learned something of fever
vagaries during the measles, when even
some of the Seniors had lost their heads.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m real!&#8221; he answered cheerfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a real boy all right. I&#8217;m
Freddy Neville, from St. Andrew&#8217;s College&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My God!&#8221; burst in a low cry from
the pale lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Freddy. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for
you to say that,&mdash;to say your prayers,
I mean; because&mdash;because&mdash;you&#8217;re very
sick, and when people are very sick, you
know, they&mdash;sometimes they die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die!&#8221; was the hoarse echo. &#8220;Aye,
die as I have lived,&mdash;in darkness, despair!
Lost&mdash;lost&mdash;lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; Boy as he was,
Freddy felt his young heart thrill at the
cry. &#8220;You&#8217;re not lost yet. You&#8217;re never
lost while you live. You can always say
an act of contrition, you know, and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
Freddy&#8217;s voice faltered, for the
role of spiritual adviser was a new one;
but he had not gone through the big
Catechism last year without learning a
young Catholic Christian&#8217;s obligations.
&#8220;Would&mdash;would you like me to say an
act of contrition for you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>There was no answer save in the
strange softening of the eyes fixed upon
the boyish face. And, feeling that his
patient was too far gone for speech,
Freddy dropped on his knees, and in a
sweet, trembling tone repeated the
brief, blessed words of sorrow for sin,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
the plea for pardon, the promise of
amendment. It had been a long, long
time since those familiar words had
fallen on his listener&#8217;s ears; a longer
time since they had reached his heart.
For years he had believed nothing,
hoped nothing, feared nothing. Life
had been to him a dull blank, broken
only by reckless adventure; death, the
end of all. But for three days and
nights he had lain helpless, fever-smitten,
stricken down in all his proud
strength in this wilderness, with no
friends but his dogs, no home but the
ruined hut into which he had crawled
for shelter, no human aid within reach
or call. The derelict, as he had called
himself to Dan, had drifted on the rocks
beyond hope and help, as derelicts must.
And in those three days and nights he
had realized that for him there was no
light in sea or sky,&mdash;that all was darkness
forever.</p>
<p>And then young voices had broken in
upon the black silence; and, opening his
eyes, closed on hideous fever dreams, he
had seen Freddy,&mdash;Freddy, who was
not a dream; Freddy, who was kneeling
by his side, whispering sweet, forgotten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
words of peace and hope and pardon;
Freddy&mdash;Freddy&mdash;he could not speak,
there was such a stirring in the depths
of his heart and soul. He could only
stretch out his weak, trembling hand,
that Freddy met with a warm, boyish
grip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m here yet!&#8221; he said, thinking
his patient needed the reassurance.
&#8220;I&#8217;m staying here right by you, to say
prayers, or get water or anything you
want. Dan left me here to take care of
you. He has gone for the doctor; and
if you just hold on till they get here,
why, maybe&mdash;maybe&mdash;they&#8217;ll pull you
through all right. Gee whilikins!&#8221; exclaimed
Freddy, as the sick man suddenly
started up from his rude pillow.
&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I must&mdash;I must!&#8221; was the hoarse
reply; and Freddy was caught in a wild,
passionate clasp to his patient&#8217;s heart.
&#8220;Dying or living, I must claim you, hold
you, my boy,&mdash;my own little son,&mdash;little
Boy Blue!&#8221; The voice sank to a low,
trembling whisper. &#8220;Little Boy Blue,
don&#8217;t you know your own daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>And Freddy, who had been struggling
wildly in what he believed to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
delirious grasp, suddenly grew still.
&#8220;Little Boy Blue,&#8221;&mdash;it was the nursery
name of long ago,&mdash;the name that only
the dad of those days knew,&mdash;the name
that even Brother Bart had never heard.
It brought back blazing fire, and cushioned
rocker, and the clasp of strong
arms around his little white-robed form,
and a deep, merry voice in his baby
ear: &#8220;Little Boy Blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Freddy lifted a frightened, bewildered
little face. The eyes,&mdash;softened
now with brimming tears; the straight
nose like his own, the waving hair, the
scar he had so often pressed with
baby fingers,&mdash;ah, he remembered,&mdash;little
Boy Blue remembered! It was as
if a curtain were snatched from a far
past that had been only dimly outlined
until now.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daddy,&mdash;my daddy,&mdash;my own
dear daddy!&#8221; he cried, flinging his arms
about the sick man&#8217;s neck. &#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t
die,&mdash;don&#8217;t die!&#8221;</p>
<p>For, weak and exhausted by his outburst
of emotion, the father had fallen
back upon his pillow, gasping for breath,
the sweat standing out in great beads on
his brow, his hand clutching Freddy&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
own in what seemed a death clasp.</p>
<p>And now Freddy prayed indeed,&mdash;prayed
as never in all his young life he
had prayed before,&mdash;prayed from the
depths of his tender, innocent heart, in
words all his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, Father in heaven, spare my
dear daddy! He has been lost so long!
Oh, do not let me lose him again! Save
him for his little boy,&mdash;save him, spare
him!&#8221;</p>
<p>Without, the sky had darkened, the
wind moaned, the waves swelled white-capped
against the low shore. The
August storm was rising against Last
Island in swift wrath; but, wrestling in
passionate fervor for the life that had
suddenly become so precious to him,
Freddy did not hear or heed. The dogs
started out into the open. Father and
son were alone in the gathering gloom.</p>
<p>Through what he believed the throes
of his death agony, the sick man caught
the sweet, faltering words: &#8220;O dear
Lord, have mercy on my dear father!
Let him live, and we will bless and
thank You all the rest of our lives. He
has been lost so long, but now he has
come back. Oh, try to say it with me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
daddy: you have come back to be good,&mdash;to
live good and live right forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, even while Freddy prayed,
the storm burst upon Last Island. And
such a storm! It seemed as if the derelict
lying there had roused wind and
wave into destructive fury against the
friendly outpost that sheltered him.
Last Island had been abandoned on account
of its perilous exposure; and its
beacon light, shattered again and again
by fierce ocean gales, was transferred
to a safer shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a-washing away fast,&#8221; old Neb
had informed Dan when they had
drifted by the low-lying shore. &#8220;Some
of these days a big storm will gulp it
down for good.&#8221;</p>
<p>And truly the roaring sea seemed to
rush upon it in hungry rage to-day. The
dogs came in crouching and whining to
their master; while the wind shrieked
and whistled, and the foaming breakers
thundered higher and higher upon the
unprotected shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;O Dan, Dan!&#8221; thought Freddy hopelessly,
as the storm beat through the
broken walls and roof. &#8220;Dan will never
get here now,&mdash;never!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>But, though his heart was quailing
within him, Brother Bart&#8217;s laddie was
no weakling: he stood bravely to his
post, bathing his father&#8217;s head and
hands, wetting the dry, muttering lips,
soothing him with tender words and
soft caresses,&mdash;&#8220;daddy, my own dear
daddy, it is your little boy that is with
you,&mdash;your own little Boy Blue! You
will be better soon, daddy.&#8221; And then
through the roar and rage of the storm
would rise the boyish voice pleading to
God for help and mercy.</p>
<p>And the innocent prayer seemed to
prevail. The sick man&#8217;s labored breathing
grew easier, the drawn features relaxed,
the blood came into the livid lips;
and, with the long-drawn sigh of one
exhausted by his struggle for life,
Freddy&#8217;s patient sank into a heavy
sleep; while his little Boy Blue watched
on, through terrors that would have
tried stronger souls than Brother Bart&#8217;s
laddie. For all the powers of earth and
air and sea seemed loosened for battle.
The winds rose into madder fury; the
rain swept down in blinding floods;
forked tongues of fire leaped from the
black clouds that thundered back to
the rolling waves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>The dogs crouched, whimpering and
shivering, at Freddy&#8217;s side. Whether
daddy was alive or dead he could not
tell. He could only keep close to him,
trembling and praying, and feeling that
all this horror of darkness could not be
real: that he would waken in a moment,&mdash;waken
as he had sometimes
wakened in St. Andrew&#8217;s, with Brother
Bart&#8217;s kind voice in his ear telling him
it was all a dream,&mdash;an awful dream.</p>
<p>And then blaze and crash and roar
would send poor little Boy Blue shivering
to his knees, realizing that it was
all true: that he was indeed here on this
far-off ocean isle, beyond all help and
reach of man, with daddy dying,&mdash;dead
beside him. He had closed the door as
best he could with its rusted bolt; but
the wind kept tearing at it madly, shaking
the rotten timbers until they suddenly
gave way, with rattle and crash
that were too much for the brave little
watcher&#8217;s nerves. He flung his arms
about his father in horror he could no
longer control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, daddy!&#8221; he cried desperately.
&#8220;Wake up,&mdash;wake up! Daddy, speak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
to me and tell me you&#8217;re not dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>And daddy started into consciousness
at the piteous cry, to find his little Boy
Blue clinging to him in wild affright,
while wind and wave burst into their
wretched shelter,&mdash;wind and wave!
Surging, foaming, sweeping over beach
and bramble and briar growth that
guarded the low shore, rising higher
and higher each moment before the
furious goad of the gale, came the
white-capped breakers!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the water is coming in on us!
Poor daddy, poor daddy, you&#8217;ll get wet!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then daddy, wild wanderer that
he had been over sea and land, roused
to the peril, his dulled brain quickening
into life.</p>
<p>&#8220;The gun,&mdash;my gun!&#8221; he said hoarsely.
&#8220;It is loaded, Freddy. Lift it up
here within reach of my hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O daddy, daddy, what are you going
to do?&#8221; cried Freddy in new alarm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shoot,&mdash;shoot! Signal for help. There
is a life-saving station not far away.
There, hold the gun closer now,&mdash;closer!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the trembling hand pulled the
trigger, and its sharp call for help went
out again and again into the storm.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>

</div>

<p>Meantime Dan had set his dingy sail to
what he felt was a changing wind, and
started Neb&#8217;s fishing boat on the
straightest line he could make for Killykinick.
But it had taken a great deal
of tacking and beating to keep to his
course. He was not yet sailor enough
to know that the bank of clouds lying
low in the far horizon meant a storm;
but the breeze that now filled and now
flapped his sail was as full of pranks as
a naughty boy. In all his experience as
second mate, Dan had never before met
so trying a breeze; and it was growing
fresher and stronger and more trying
every minute. To beat back to Beach
Cliff against its vagaries, our young
navigator felt would be beyond his skill.
The only thing he could do was to take
the shorter course of about three miles
to Killykinick, and send off Jim and
Dud in their rented boat (which had a
motor) for a doctor. Then he could explain
Freddy&#8217;s absence to Brother Bart,
and hurry back to his little chum.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>Wind and tide, however, were both
against these well-laid plans to-day.
The wind was bad enough, but now even
the waves seemed to have a strange
swell, different from the measured rise
and fall he knew. It was as if their far-off
depths were rising, stirring out of
their usual calm. They no longer tossed
their snowy crests in the summer sunlight,
but surged and swayed in low,
broken lines, white-capped with fitful
foam. And the voice&mdash;the song of the
sea&mdash;that had been a very lullaby to
Dan as he swung every night in his
hammock beneath the stars, had a
hoarse, fierce tone, like a sob of passion
or pain. Altogether, Dan and his boat
had a very hard pull over the three
miles to Killykinick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar they come!&#8221; said Captain Jeb,
who, with Brother Bart, was watching
from the beach. &#8220;I told you you could
count on Mate Dan, Padre. Thar the
lads come, safe and sound; though they
hed a pull against the wind, I bet. But
here they come all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God be thanked for that same!&#8221; said
Brother Bart, reverently. &#8220;My heart
has been nearly leaping out of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
breast this last half hour. And you
weren&#8217;t over-easy about them yourself,
as I could see, Jeroboam.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wall, I&#8217;m glad to see the younkers
safe back, I must say,&#8221; agreed Captain
Jeb, in frank relief. &#8220;Thar was nothing
to skeer about when they started this
morning, but that bank of cloud wasn&#8217;t
in sight then. My but it come up sudden!
It fairly took my breath when Neb
pointed it out to me. That ar marline
spike didn&#8217;t hurt his weather eye.
&#8216;Hurricane,&#8217; he says to me; &#8216;straight up
from the West Indies, and them boys is
out!&#8217; I tell you it did give me a turn&mdash;aye,
aye matey!&#8221; as Dan came hurrying
up the beach. &#8220;Ye made it all right
again wind an&#8217; tide&mdash;but where&#8217;s the
other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laddie,&mdash;my laddie!&#8221; cried Brother
Bart, his ruddy face paling. &#8220;Speak up,
Dan Dolan! Has harm come to him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no!&#8221; answered Dan eagerly,
&#8220;no harm at all, Brother Bart. He is
safe and sound. Don&#8217;t scare, Brother
Bart.&#8221; And then as briefly as he could
Dan told the adventure of the morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you left laddie, that lone innocent,
with a dying man?&#8221; said Brother
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
Bart. &#8220;Sure it will frighten the life out
of him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it won&#8217;t,&#8221; replied Dan. &#8220;Freddy
isn&#8217;t the baby you think, Brother Bart.
He&#8217;s got lots of sand. He was ready
and willing to stay. We couldn&#8217;t leave
the poor man there alone with the dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you couldn&#8217;t,&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t,&#8221;
said the good Brother, his tone softening.
&#8220;But laddie&mdash;little laddie,&mdash;that
never saw sickness or death! Send off
the other boys for the doctor, Jeroboam,
and the priest as well, while Dan and I
go back for laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Captain Jeroboam, who was
watching the horizon with a wide-awake
weather eye, shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, Padre,&mdash;you can&#8217;t. Not
even the &#8216;Lady Jane&#8217; could make it agin
what&#8217;s coming on now. If the boy is
on dry land, you&#8217;ll have to trust him to
the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; answered the good
Brother, forgetting what he said, in his
solicitude. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go for him myself.
Give us your boat, man, and Dan and I
will go for laddie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye can&#8217;t, I tell ye!&#8221; and the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
sailor&#8217;s voice took a sudden tone of command.
&#8220;I&#8217;m captain of this here Killykinick,
Padre; and no boat leaves this
shore in the face of such a storm, for it
would mean death to every man aboard
her,&mdash;sure and certain death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Lord have mercy,&mdash;the Lord
have mercy!&#8221; cried Brother Bart. &#8220;My
laddie,&mdash;my poor little laddie! The
fright of this will kill him entirely. Oh,
but you&#8217;re the hard man, Jeroboam!
You have no heart!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back!&#8221; shouted Captain Jeb, heedless
of the good old man&#8217;s reproaches,
as a whistling sound came over the
white-capped waves. &#8220;Back, under
cover, all of ye. The storm is on us
now!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, fairly dragging Brother Bart,
while Neb and Dan hurried behind
them, the Captain made for shelter in
the old ship under the cliffs, where Dud
and Jim had already found refuge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Down with the hatches! Brace
everything!&#8221; came the trumpet tones of
command of the old sailor over the roar
of the wind. And doors and portholes
shut, the heavy bolts of iron and timber
fell into place, and everything was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
made tight and fast against the storm
that now burst in all its fury on Killykinick,&mdash;a
storm that sent Brother Bart
down on his knees in prayer, and held
the boys speechless and almost breathless
with terror. In the awful blackness
that fell upon them they could
scarcely see one another. The &#8220;Lady
Jane&#8221; shook from stem to stern as if
she were being torn from her fifty
years&#8217; mooring. The stout awnings were
ripped from the upper deck; their posts
snapped like reeds in the gale; the great
hollows of the Devil&#8217;s Jaw thundered
back the roar of the breakers that filled
their cavernous depths with mad turmoil.
On land, on sea, in sky, all was
battle,&mdash;such battle as even Captain
Jeb agreed he had never seen on Killykinick
before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve faced many a hurricane, but
never nothing as bad as this. If it
wasn&#8217;t for them cliffs behind us and
the stretch of reef before, durned if we
wouldn&#8217;t be washed clean off the face
of the earth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laddie, laddie!&#8221; was the cry that
blended with Brother Bart&#8217;s prayers for
mercy. &#8220;God in heaven, take care of my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
poor laddie through this! I ought not to
have let him out of my sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s safe, Brother Bart,&#8221; said
Dan, striving to comfort himself with
the thought. &#8220;He is on land, you know,
just as we are; and the old lighthouse
is as strong as the &#8216;Lady Jane&#8217;;
and God can take care of him anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure He can, lad,&mdash;He can. I&#8217;m the
weak old sinner to doubt and fear,&#8221; was
the broken answer. &#8220;But he&#8217;s only a bit
of a boy, my own little laddie,&mdash;only a
wee bit of a boy, that never saw trouble
or danger in his life. To be facing this
beside a dying man,&mdash;ah, God have
mercy on him, poor laddie!&#8221;</p>
<p>So, amid fears and doubts and
prayers, the wild hours of the storm and
darkness passed; the fierce hurricane,
somewhat shorn of its first tropic
strength, swept on its northward way;
the shriek of the wind sank into moan
and murmur; the sea fell back, like a
passion-weary giant; the clouds broke
and scattered, and a glorious rainbow
arched the clearing sky.</p>
<p>The bolts and bars that had done such
good duty were lifted, and the crew of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8221; went out to reconnoitre
a very damaged domain. Cow-house
and chicken-house were roofless.
Brown Betty lay crouching fearful in
the ruins while her feathered neighbors
fluttered homeless in the hollows of the
rocks. The beans and peas and corn,&mdash;all
things that had lifted their green
growth too proudly, were crushed to the
earth. But far worse than this was
the havoc wrought on the beach. One
half of the wharf was down. The small
boats, torn from their moorings, had disappeared
entirely. The motor boat Jim
and Dud had hired for the season was
stove in upon the rocks. The &#8220;Sary
Ann,&#8221; stranded upon the shoals of
Numskull Nob, to which she had been
swept by the gale, lay without mast or
rudder, leaking at every joint.</p>
<p>The two old salts surveyed the scene
for a moment in stoic silence, realizing
all it meant to them. But Brother Bart,
with the sunlight dancing on the waves,
the rainbow arching the sky, broke into
eager, hopeful speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;God be thanked it&#8217;s over and we&#8217;re
all alive to tell it; for Noah&#8217;s deluge
itself couldn&#8217;t have been worse. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
now, Jeroboam, we&#8217;ll be going over
after laddie; and the Lord grant that
we may find him safe as the rest!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be going after him!&#8221; repeated
Captain Jeb, grimly. &#8220;How and whar!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure&mdash;can&#8217;t we right one of the
boats?&#8221; asked the old man, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which boat,&#8221; was the gruff question.
&#8220;That thar play toy&#8221; (surveying the
motor boat) &#8220;is smashed in like an eggshell.
Whar the other has been swept to
nobody knows. And the &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217; has
done her best, as we all can see; but no
boat could hold her own agin that
storm. Do you think she will stand till
morning, Neb?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neb rolled his dull eyes over reef and
shoal.</p>
<p>&#8220;She moight,&#8221; he replied briefly.
&#8220;Struck pretty bad thar in the bow; but
the wind is down now and the tide is
low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she is oak-keeled and copper-braced
from stem to stern,&#8221; continued
Captain Jeb. &#8220;She may stick it out until
we can get thar and tow her in. As for
the boy, Padre, we can&#8217;t reach him no
more&#8217;n we can reach the &#8216;Sary Ann&#8217;
without a boat; and thar&#8217;s nothing left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
that will float around this Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, the Lord have mercy! And are
we to leave laddie in that wild place
beyond all night?&#8221; cried Brother Bart.
&#8220;Scatter, boys,&mdash;scatter all over the
place, and maybe you can find a boat
caught in the rocks and sands; for we
must get to the laddie afore the night
comes on, cost what it may. Scatter
and strive to find a boat!&#8221;</p>
<p>While the boys scattered eagerly
enough Captain Jeb, making a spyglass
of his hands, was scanning the horizon
with a sailor&#8217;s practised eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it you see?&#8221; asked Brother
Bart, anxiously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me it&#8217;s another
storm!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered Captain Jeb, slowly,
&#8220;it ain&#8217;t another storm. Neb&#8221; (his tone
grew suddenly sharper and quicker),
&#8220;step up to the ship and get the old
man&#8217;s glass,&mdash;the glass we keep shut up
in the case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neb, who never shirked an order,
obeyed. In a moment he returned with
one of the greatest treasures of the
&#8220;Lady Jane&#8221;&mdash;Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s ship-glass
that was always kept safe from
profaning touch; its clear lenses, that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
had looked out on sea and sky through
many a long voyage, polished to a shine.
Captain Jeb adjusted them to his own
failing eyes, and gazed seaward for a
few moments in silence. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Pears as if I couldn&#8217;t see clarly
after that tarnation blow. You look out,
Neb. And, Padre, you&#8217;d better step
back thar and keep a weather eye on
them younkers. It doesn&#8217;t do to turn
them out too free, with things all broke
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, man,&mdash;you&#8217;re right,
Jeroboam,&#8221; said the good Brother
tremulously. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep an eye on them,
as you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thar,&mdash;I&#8217;ve got him out of the way!&#8221;
said Captain Neb, as Brother Bart
hurried back to watch over his scattered
flock. &#8220;Now look, Neb,&mdash;look steady
and straight! Three points to the south
of Numskull Nob,&mdash;what d&#8217;ye see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing at all,&#8221; answered Neb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look again!&#8221; His brother adjusted
the old shipmaster&#8217;s glass with a hand
that trembled strangely. &#8220;Another point
to the south. Look steady as ye can,
Neb. Yer weather eye was always
clarer than mine. What d&#8217;ye see now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; came the answer again;
and then the dull tone quickened: &#8220;Aye
I do,&mdash;I do! Thar&#8217;s suthing sticking out
of the waves like a broken mast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Old Light,&#8221; said Captain Jeb,
hoarsely,&mdash;&#8220;all that&#8217;s left of it. Last
Island has gone under, as you said it
would, Neb,&mdash;clean swallowed up. And
the boy&mdash;&#8221; (the speaker gulped down
something like a sob). &#8220;Looks as if the
Padre will never see his little lad agin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XXII.&mdash;The Lost And Found.</p>
</div>

<p>There had been an extra Mass at the
little church at Beach Cliff on the morning
of the storm. Father Tom Rayburn,
an old classmate of the pastor&#8217;s, had arrived,
and been welcomed most cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off to an old camping ground of
mine&mdash;Killykinick,&#8221; he had explained
to his host as they sat together at breakfast.
&#8220;One of our Brothers is there
with some of St. Andrew&#8217;s boys, and my
own little nephew is among them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I know!&#8221; was the reply.
&#8220;They come every Sunday to the late
Mass. And, by the way, if you are going
out into those ocean &#8216;wilds,&#8217; you could
save a busy man some trouble by stopping
at the Life-Saving Station (it&#8217;s not
far out of the way, as I suppose you&#8217;ll
take a sail or a motor boat); and I
promised two of those sturdy fellows
who are groping for the Truth some
reading matter. I thought a friendly
talk at the same time would not be
amiss. They have little chance for such
things in their lonely lives. But my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
duties are quadrupled at this season, as
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the &#8216;wilderness&#8217; is in my line,&#8221;
said Father Tom. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll be glad
to stop. I used to haunt the Life-Saving
Station when I was a boy; and I should
like to see it again, especially when I
can do a little missionary work on the
side,&#8221; he laughed cheerily.</p>
<p>And so it had happened that while
Dan and Freddy were hauling in their
lines and delivering breakfasts along
the shore, one of the trig motors from
the Boat Club was bearing a tall, broad-shouldered
passenger, bronzed by sun
and storm, to the Life-Saving Station,
whose long, low buildings stood on a
desolate spit of sand that jutted out into
the sea beyond Shelter Cove. It was
Uncle Sam&#8217;s farthest outpost. The Stars
and Stripes floating from its flagstaff
told of his watchful care of this perilous
stretch of shore that his sturdy sons
paced by day and night, alert to any cry
for help, any sign of danger.</p>
<p>Father Tom, whose own life work lay
in some such lines, met the Life-Savers
with a warm, cordial sympathy that
made his visit a most pleasant one. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
was ready to listen as well as talk. But
Blake and Ford, whom he had come
especially to see, were on duty up the
shore, and would not be back for more
than two hours.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait for them,&#8221; said Father Tom,
who never let a wandering sheep, that
hook or crook could hold, escape his
shepherd&#8217;s care; and he settled down
for a longer chat of his own wild and
woolly West, which his hearers watching
with trained eyes the black line in
the horizon, were too polite in their own
simple way to interrupt. Their guest
was in the midst of a description of the
Mohave Desert, where he had nearly
left his bones to bleach two years ago,
when his boatman came hurriedly up
with a request of speedy shelter for his
little craft.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a storm coming up I daren&#8217;t
face, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t make
Killykinick until it blows over. You&#8217;ll
have to stay another hour or two here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, if our good friends will
keep us,&#8221; was the cheery response. &#8220;We
are not travelling on schedule time.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Father Tom looked on with
keen interest as the sturdy life-savers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
made ready for the swift-coming tempest
that was very soon upon them,
bringing Blake and Ford back, breathless
and drenched, to report their observations
along the beach,&mdash;that there
was nothing in sight: everything had
scudded to shelter. So all gathered in
the lookout, whose heavy leaded glass,
set in a stone frame, defied the fury of
the elements. And, thus sheltered, the
group in Uncle Sam&#8217;s outpost watched
the sweep of the storm.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a ripper!&#8221; said Blake, translating
the more professional opinion of his
mates to Father Tom. &#8220;But we ain&#8217;t
getting the worst of it here. These West
Indianers travel narrow gauge tracks,
and we&#8217;re out of line. Killykinick is
catching it bad. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if
that stranded tub of the old Captain&#8217;s
would keel over altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think they are in danger
there?&#8221; asked Father Tom, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no! Thar&#8217;s plenty of other shelter.
Killykinick is rock-ribbed to stand
till the day of doom. George! I believe
Last Island is going clean under!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go!&#8221; came the keeper&#8217;s bluff
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
response. &#8220;Been nothing but a bramble
bed these twenty years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bramble bed or not, some fools are
camping there,&#8221; said Blake. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen
their dogs on the beach for the last
three days; and there was a boat
moored to the rocks this morning, and
boys scrambling along the shore. The
folks that are boxed up in town all
winter run wild when they break loose
here, and don&#8217;t care where they go&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; broke in the keeper, suddenly.
&#8220;Push open the glass there, men,
and listen! I think I heard a gun!&#8221;</p>
<p>They flung open the window at his
word. Borne upon the wild sweep of the
wind that rushed in upon them, there
came again a sound they all knew,&mdash;the
signal of distress, the sharp call for
help. It was their business to hear and
heed.</p>
<p>&#8220;A gun sure, and from Last Island!&#8221;
said the keeper, briefly. &#8220;There are fools
there, as you say, Blake. Run out the
lifeboat, my men! We must get them
off. Both boats, for we don&#8217;t know how
many we have to care for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Both boats, sir?&#8221; hesitated Blake.
&#8220;We&#8217;re short-handed to-day, for Ford
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
has a crippled arm that would be no
good in this surf.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take his place,&#8221; said Father Tom,
eagerly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve shot the rapids with my
Indian guides many a time. I&#8217;ll take
Ford&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think twice of it, sir,&#8221; was Blake&#8217;s
warning. &#8220;You are risking your life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; was the brief answer.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my business as well as yours,
my friends; so I&#8217;ll take my chance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There talks a man!&#8221; said the keeper,
heartily. &#8220;Give him a sou&#8217;wester, and
let him take his chances, as he asks, in
Ford&#8217;s place.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, in briefer time than we can
picture, the two lifeboats were swung
out of their shelter in the very teeth of
the driving gale, and manned by their
fearless crews, including Father Tom
Rayburn, who, muffled in a huge sou&#8217;wester,
took his place with the rest;
and all pushed into the storm.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At Last Island all hope seemed gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;One last shot, my boy!&#8221; daddy had
said, as the gun dropped from his shaking
hand. &#8220;And no one has heard,&mdash;no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
one could hear in the roar of the
storm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they could,&mdash;they could!&#8221; murmured
Freddy. &#8220;God could make them
hear, daddy,&mdash;make them hear and
come to help us. And I think He will.
I have prayed so hard that we might
not be drowned here all alone in the
storm. You pray, too, daddy,&mdash;oh,
please pray!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not,&mdash;I <i>dare</i> not,&#8221; was the
hoarse answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;O daddy, yes you can,&mdash;you must!
The waters are coming on us so fast,
daddy,&mdash;so fast! Please try to pray
with me. Our Lord made the winds and
waves go down when He lived here on
earth; He walked on the waters and
they did not hurt Him. Oh, they are
coming higher and higher on us, daddy!
What shall we do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die,&#8221; was the hoarse, fierce answer;
&#8220;die here together, my boy,&mdash;my little
boy! For me it is justice, judgment;
but, O my God, why should Thy curse
fall on my boy,&mdash;my innocent boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O daddy, no! That isn&#8217;t the way to
pray. You mustn&#8217;t say &#8216;curse,&#8217; daddy.
You must say: &#8216;Have mercy, dear Lord;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
have mercy! Save me and my little boy.
Send some one to help us.&#8217; Oh, I am
trying not to be afraid, but I can&#8217;t help
it, daddy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My boy,&mdash;my poor little boy! Climb,
Freddy! Try to climb up on the roof&mdash;the
broken shaft! Leave me here, and
try to climb, my boy! You may be safe
for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O daddy, no, I can&#8217;t climb and leave
you,&#8221; and Freddy clung piteously to his
father&#8217;s breast. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather die here
with you, and God will take us both to
heaven together. I haven&#8217;t been a very
good boy, I know; and maybe you
haven&#8217;t either; but if we are sorry He
will let us come to Him in heaven&mdash;O
dad, what is that?&#8221; Freddy&#8217;s low tone
changed to one of wild alarm. &#8220;What
is it now,&mdash;what is it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>For the dogs, that had been crouching
and cowering beside their master, suddenly
started up, barking wildly, and
dashed out into the rising waters; new
sounds blended with the roar of the
storm,&mdash;shouts, cries, voices.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&mdash;<i>here</i>!&#8221; daddy feebly essayed
to answer. &#8220;Call to them, Freddy! It is
help. God has heard your prayers.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
Call&mdash;call&mdash;call&mdash;loud as you can, my
boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>But there was no need. Rex and Roy
had already done the calling, the guiding.
On they came, the sturdy rescuers,
plunging waist-deep through the waters
that were already breaking high on the
beach and bramble growth, surging and
swelling across the broken wall that had
once guarded the Old Light, and lapping
the low cabin floor. On the brave life-savers
came, while Rex and Roy barked
in mad welcome; and Freddy&#8217;s clear,
boyish cry, &#8220;Here,&mdash;here! Daddy and I
are here!&#8221; pierced through the darkness
and turmoil of the storm. On they came,
strong and fearless,&mdash;God&#8217;s angels
surely, thought Freddy, though in
strange mortal guise. And one, whose
muffling sou&#8217;wester had been flung loose
in his eager haste, led all the rest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, my men,&mdash;here!&#8221; he cried,
bursting into the ruined hut, where a
little figure stood, white-faced, breathless,
bewildered with the joy of his
answered prayer. &#8220;They are here! God
have mercy!&#8221; broke in reverent awe
from his lips. &#8220;Freddy, Freddy,&mdash;my
own little Freddy here!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Tom,&mdash;Uncle Tom!&#8221; And
Freddy sobbed outright as he was
clasped in those dear, strong arms, held
tight to the loving heart. &#8220;How did God
tell you where to come for me, dear
Uncle Tom?&mdash;Daddy, daddy look up,&mdash;look
up! It&#8217;s Uncle Tom!&#8221;</p>
<p>And what daddy felt as he looked up
into that old friend&#8217;s face, what Uncle
Tom felt as he looked down on the
&#8220;derelict&#8221; that had drifted so far from
him, no one can say; for there was no
time for words or wonderment. Life-savers
can not stop to think, much less
to talk. Daddy was caught up by two
or three big fellows, without any question,
while Uncle Tom looked out for
Freddy.</p>
<p>It was a fierce struggle, through surging
waves and battering wind and beating
rain, to the waiting lifeboats; but,
held tight in those strong arms, pressed
close to the true heart whose every
pulse was a prayer, Freddy felt no fear.
Even when the stout boat, fighting its
way back to the other shore, tossed like
a cork in the breakers, when the oar
snapped in Blake&#8217;s hand, when all
around was foam and spray, in which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
earth and heaven seemed lost, Freddy,
nestling in Uncle Tom&#8217;s sou&#8217;wester, felt
as if its rough, tarry folds were angel
wings.</p>
<p>And so safety and shelter were
reached at last. Father Tom gave his
little drenched, shivering, white-faced
boy into Ford&#8217;s friendly care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Put him to bed somewhere, to get
dry and warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But daddy,&mdash;my own dear, lost
daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him to me, my boy,&#8221; said
Uncle Tom, softly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of
daddy. Leave him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Ford, who, somewhere back
of Cape Cod, had a small boy of his own,
proceeded to do his rough best for the
little stranger. Freddy was dried,
rubbed, and put into a flannel shirt some
ten sizes too big for him, and given
something hot and spicy to drink, and
finally tumbled into a bunk with
coarse but spotless sheets, and very
rough but comfortable blankets, where
in less than four minutes he was sound
asleep, worn out, as even the pluckiest
eleven-year-old boy would be, with the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
strain on his small body and brave
young soul.</p>
<p>How long he slept, Freddy did not
know; but it was long enough for the
wind to lull, the skies to brighten, the
black clouds to break and scatter before
the golden glory of the summer sun.
The wide lookout window had been
thrown open, and showed a glorious
rainbow spanning the western sky. And
there, on a pallet thrown hastily on the
floor, lay daddy, very still and pale, with
Uncle Tom kneeling beside him, holding
his hand. An icy fear now clutched
Freddy&#8217;s heart at the sight. Reckless
of the ten-sizes-too-big shirt trailing
around him, he was out of his bunk
with a jump to his father&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy, daddy!&mdash;O Uncle Tom, is
daddy dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>And daddy&#8217;s eyes opened at the
words,&mdash;eyes that were no longer burning,
but soft and dim with tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not dead, little Boy Blue! Daddy is
alive again,&mdash;alive as he has not been
for long, long years.&mdash;Tell him all, Tom.
I am too weak. Tell him all. He&#8217;ll be
glad to hear it, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Father Tom only put his arm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
around the boy and drew him close to
his side.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I?&#8221; he said, smiling into
the upturned face. &#8220;We know quite
enough for a little boy; don&#8217;t we,
Freddy,&mdash;that, like another wanderer
from his Father&#8217;s house, daddy was
dead and is alive again, was lost and is
found. And now get into some short
clothes, if you can find them, and we&#8217;ll
go over to Killykinick in my little
motor boat; for poor Brother Bart is in
sad terror about you, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, in sad terror, indeed! It was a
pale, shaken old man that stood on the
beach at Killykinick, looking over the
sea, and listening to the Captain, who
was striving to find hope where he felt
there was none.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if the old cabin on Last
Island might be holding together still.
Dan and Neb are knocking a raft together,
and if they can make it float
they&#8217;ll go over there and get the little
lad off. And if they don&#8217;t Padre&#8221; (the
rough old voice trembled),&mdash;&#8220;if they
don&#8217;t, wal, you are sky pilot enough to
know that the little chap has reached a
better shore than this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Aye, aye, I know, Jeroboam!&#8221; was
the hoarse, shaken answer. &#8220;God knows
what is best for His little lamb. His
holy will be done. But, O my laddie, my
little laddie, why did I let you go from
me into the darkness and storm, my
little boy, my little boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray! Hooray!&#8221; Wild shouts
broke in upon the broken-hearted
prayer, as Jim and Dud and Dan burst
round the bend of the rocks. &#8220;Brother
Bart, Brother Bart! Look what&#8217;s coming,
Brother Bart!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, turning his dim eyes where the
boys pointed, Brother Bart saw a little
motor boat making its swift way over
the still swelling waves. On it came,
dancing in the sunlight arched by the
rainbow, tossing and swaying to the
pulse of the sea; and in the stern, enthusiastically
waving the little signal
flag that Ford had put into his hand to
remember the life-savers, sat&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Laddie!&#8221; burst from Brother Bart&#8217;s
lips, and he fell upon his knees in
thanksgiving. &#8220;O God be praised and
blessed for the sight! My laddie,&mdash;my
own little laddie safe, safe,&mdash;my laddie
coming back to me again!&#8221;

<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XXIII.&mdash;Dan&#8217;s Medal.</p>
</div>

<p>It was the day after the big storm that
had made havoc even in the sheltered
harbor of Beach Cliff, and so damaged
&#8220;The Polly&#8221; in her safe moorings that
six men were busy putting her into
shipshape again. And dad&#8217;s other Polly
was in an equally doleful mood.</p>
<p>It was to have been a day of jollification
with Marraine. They were to have
gone voyaging together over the summer
seas, that were smiling as joyously
to-day as if they had never known a
storm. They were to have stopped at
the college camp in Shelter Cove, where
Marraine had some girl friends; they
were to have kept on their sunlit way
to Killykinick, for so dad had agreed;
they were to have looked in on the Life-Saving
Station, which Marraine had
never seen; in fact, they were to have
done more pleasant things than Polly
could count,&mdash;and now the storm had
fallen on her namesake and spoiled all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Pollykins!&#8221; comforted
Marraine, who could find stars in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
darkest sky. &#8220;We&#8217;ll each take a dollar
and go shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a dollar, Marraine? That won&#8217;t
buy much,&#8221; said Polly, who had walked
in ways where dollars seem very small
indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it will! There&#8217;s no telling
what it can buy in Jonah&#8217;s junk shop,&#8221;
laughed Marraine. &#8220;I got a rusted tea
tray that polished into silver plate, a
blackened vase that rubbed into burnished
copper. I should not wonder if he
had an Aladdin&#8217;s lamp hidden somewhere
in his dusty shelves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go look for it,&#8221; said Polly,
roused into gleeful interest. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d
love to have Aladdin&#8217;s lamp! Wouldn&#8217;t
you, Marraine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you wish for, Pollykins?&#8221;
asked Marraine, softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, lots of things!&#8221; said Polly,
perching in her lap. &#8220;First&mdash;first of all,
I wish that I could keep you here forever
and forever, darling Marraine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you have me for six weeks
every summer,&#8221; laughed Marraine.</p>
<p>&#8220;But that isn&#8217;t forever and forever,&#8221;
sighed Polly. &#8220;And mamma and dad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
and grandmamma and everybody else
want you, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of that?&#8221; asked the
lady, kissing the upturned face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, very sure!&#8221; replied Polly, positively.
&#8220;They say it&#8217;s all nonsense for
you to go to the hospital and take care
of sick people. It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s something&mdash;I
don&#8217;t remember what.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stubborn pride?&#8221; suggested Marraine,
with a merry sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Polly, &#8220;that&#8217;s just what
grandmamma said. And stubborn pride
is something bad; isn&#8217;t it, Marraine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, it is,&#8221; agreed Marraine,&mdash;&#8220;when
it <i>is</i> stubborn pride, Pollykins.
But when one has empty hands and
empty purse and&mdash;well, an empty life,
too, Pollykins, it is not stubborn pride
to try to fill them with work and care
and pity and help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is what you do at the hospital,
Marraine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is what I try to do, Pollykins.
When my dear father died, and I found
all his money gone, this beautiful home
of yours opened its doors wide for me;
dad, mamma, grandma, everybody
begged me to come here. But&mdash;but it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
wasn&#8217;t my real home or my real place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, wasn&#8217;t it, Marraine?&#8221; said Polly,
sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, dear. In our real home, our real
place, God gives us work to do,&mdash;some
work, even though it be only to bless
and love. But there was no work for me
here; and so I looked around, Pollykins,
for my work and my place. If I had
been very, <i>very</i> good, I might have
folded my butterfly wings under a veil
and habit, and been a nice little nun,
like Sister Claudine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I wouldn&#8217;t have liked that at
all!&#8221; said Polly, with a shiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I wouldn&#8217;t either,&#8221; was
the laughing answer. &#8220;Still, it&#8217;s a lovely,
useful, beautiful life, little girl. And the
next&mdash;the very next&mdash;best place and
best work seemed to me the hospital,
with the white gown and cap I can put
off when I please; with sickness and
sorrow and suffering to soothe and help;
with little children holding out their
arms to me, and old people calling to me
in their pain, and dying eyes turning to
me for hope and help. So I am nurse
in a hospital, and out of it, too, when
there is need. And it&#8217;s not for stubborn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
pride, as grandma says, and no doubt
thinks; but because I believe it to be my
real work and my real place. Now get
your dollar, and we&#8217;ll be off to Jonah&#8217;s
junk shop to look for Aladdin&#8217;s lamp.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Polly danced off for her flower-wreathed
hat, and the two were soon on
their way down the narrow streets to
the dull, dingy little shop near the
water, where several customers were
already looking over the curiously assorted
stock, that on weekdays was
spread far out on the sidewalk to attract
passers-by. Among these was a big,
burly grey-haired man, whose bronzed
face and easy-fitting clothes proclaimed
the sailor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Captain Carleton!&#8221; greeted
Miss Stella, in some surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless my heart and soul!&#8221; was
the hearty response, and the Captain
held out both hands to the speaker.
&#8220;This is sailor&#8217;s luck, indeed! From
what star of hope did you drop, Miss
Stella?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I drop here for a holiday every
summer!&#8221; she answered gaily. &#8220;I am
glad to see you looking so well and
strong again, Captain.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, my dear lady! Under
the great Master of life and death,
thanks to you! I was about as far on
the rocks as an old craft could be without
going to pieces entirely. How that
soft little hand of yours steered me into
safe water I&#8217;ll never forget, dear lady,&mdash;never
forget. And I was a tough patient,
too; wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did say things sometimes
that were not&mdash;prayers,&#8221; was the
laughing answer.</p>
<p>And, chatting on pleasantly of the
Captain&#8217;s last winter in the hospital,
they glanced over old Jonah&#8217;s stock until
something of interest caught the
sailor&#8217;s eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George! How in thunder did this
get here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A find,&mdash;a real find, Captain?&#8221; asked
Miss Stella. &#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A medal,&#8221; he answered,&mdash;&#8220;a medal
awarded for &#8216;Brave and faithful service
on the &#8220;Reina Maria&#8221; sixty years ago.&#8217;&#8221;
(He was scanning the bronze disc as he
spoke),&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Juan Farley.&#8217; Good Lord!
Yes, poor old Jack! I wonder how he
lived and died? And what in Heaven&#8217;s
name is his medal doing here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps Jonah can tell you,&#8221; suggested
Miss Stella; while Polly, whose
bright eyes were searching for Aladdin&#8217;s
lamp, paused to listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;That ar medal?&#8221; said Jonah in
answer to the Captain&#8217;s questioning.
&#8220;Let me think now! That ar medal&mdash;ticketed
nineteen, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;was left
here by a youngster. Now, what in
thunder was his name? I&#8217;ll have to look
in my books to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>And while he looked Captain Carleton
explained his interest in his find.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, my father was master and
half owner of the &#8216;Reina Maria,&#8217; though
she was Spanish built and manned. But,
luckily, Jack Farley, a first-class sailor,
was second mate. There was a mutiny
aboard, and it would have been all up
with my father and his chief officer if
brave Jack had not smelled mischief in
time, and put down the hatches on the
scoundrels at the risk of his own life.
Ship and cargo (it was a pretty valuable
ship) were saved; and this medal,
that bears the stamp of her then Spanish
Majesty, was Jack&#8217;s reward. My
father always felt that he ought to have
had something more; but the Spanish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
owners were close-fisted, so my old man
had to content himself with helping
Jack (who was a rather reckless sort of
chap ashore) in his own way. He got
him out of many a tight place on the
strength of that medal; and he would
have looked out for him until the last,
but he shipped on an East Indian, and
drifted out of our reach. And this
medal was left here by a boy, you say,
my man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&#8221; (Jonah had found his entry
now),&mdash;&#8220;by a boy who said it was
his: that it had been given him by an
old sailor man who was dead; and he&#8217;d
like to sell the medal now, for he wanted
some money bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said the old Captain, eagerly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give him his price. Who and
where is the boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His name is Dan Dolan and he lives
at Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan!&#8221; exclaimed Miss Stella.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, does he mean my&mdash;<i>my</i> Dan,
Marraine?&#8221; chirped Polly, breathlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! You know the boy?&#8221; cried
the old sailor, in amazement. &#8220;God bless
me,&mdash;you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, we know him,&mdash;don&#8217;t we,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
Pollykins?&#8221; said Miss Stella. &#8220;But what
he is doing with the medal we can&#8217;t say.
We&#8217;re certain he has it rightfully and
honestly; and as soon as &#8216;The Polly&#8217;
(my cousin&#8217;s yacht) can spread her
broken wings, we are going to Killykinick.
Suppose you come with us, and
see the owner of the medal, and strike
a bargain yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, I will,&mdash;I will! A sail
with you, Miss Stella, is a temptation I
can not resist. And I must have the
medal. I must see the boy, and hear
how he got it. I&#8217;ll buy it from him at
his own price; and you shall negotiate
the sale, dear lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care,&#8221; said Miss Stella, with a
merry sparkle in her eyes,&mdash;&#8220;take care
how you do business with me, Captain!
Remember how I drew upon you for the
babies&#8217; ward last winter! I can fleece
without mercy, as you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fleece as you please,&#8221; was the
hearty answer. &#8220;I can stand it, for that
soft little hand of yours did work for
this old man that he can never repay.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the agreement was made; and
Miss Stella, having invested in a queer,
twisted candlestick, which she declared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
was quite equal to Aladdin&#8217;s lamp, and
Polly having decided to reserve her
dollar for a neighboring candy store,
the party at Jonah&#8217;s junk shop separated,
with the promise of meeting as
soon as &#8220;The Polly&#8221; should be ready for
a flight to Killykinick.</p>
<p>But that pleasant excursion was indefinitely
postponed; for when Miss
Stella reached Polly&#8217;s home it was to
find two priestly visitors awaiting her.
One was an old friend, the present pastor
of St. Mary&#8217;s Church, near the
Foresters&#8217; home; the other, tall, pale
even through his bronze, anxious-eyed,
she had never met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father Rayburn, Miss Allen,&#8221; was
the pastor&#8217;s brief introduction. &#8220;We
have come to throw ourselves on your
mercy, my dear young lady. You are
here for your summer holiday, I know;
and I hesitate to interrupt it. But
Father Rayburn is in sore need of experienced
service that you alone can
give.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need a nurse?&#8221; asked Miss
Stella.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; (It was Father Rayburn who
answered.) &#8220;My brother&mdash;or perhaps I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
should say my brother-in-law, as that is
really our relationship,&mdash;is lying very
ill at Killykinick. While still prostrated
with fever, he was exposed to the storm
of yesterday, in which he nearly lost
his life. Between the shock, the excitement
of his rescue by the life-savers, he
is very, very ill,&mdash;too ill to be removed
to a hospital; and he is at Killykinick
with only boys and men to care for
him,&#8221; continued Father Rayburn. &#8220;The
doctors tell me an experienced nurse is
necessary, and we can find none willing
to take so serious a case in such a rude,
remote place. But my good friend
Father John seems to think that you
would take pity on our great need.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I will,&mdash;I will!&#8221; was the eager
answer. &#8220;I already have friends at
Killykinick among those fine boys from
St. Andrew&#8217;s. My little goddaughter
and I were to make an excursion there
to-day, but the storm disabled Mr.
Forester&#8217;s yacht. I am so glad to be of
service to you, Father! I will get ready
at once.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>In spite of the joyful return of laddie
yesterday, there was gloom this morning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
at Killykinick. Daddy, who had been
brought over at his own request from
the Life-Saving Station, lay in the old
Captain&#8217;s room, which Brother Bart
had resigned to him, very, very sick
indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sinking fast, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; the doctor
said. &#8220;The fever has broken, but the
shock of yesterday&#8217;s danger and rescue
has been too much for a man in his
weakened state. Still there&#8217;s a chance
for him&mdash;a fighting chance. But it will
take very careful and experienced nursing
to pull him through.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Father Tom had gone in search of
a nurse, leaving Freddy and Brother
Bart watching by the sick bed; while
Dan, who as second mate was assisting
his chief officers to right and repair the
&#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221; listened with a heavy heart
to the old salt&#8217;s prognostications.</p>
<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t last the day out,&#8221; declared
Captain Jeb. &#8220;Blue about the gills
already! But, Lord, what could you expect,
doused and drenched and shaken
up like he was yesterday? It will be
hard on the little chap, who was so glad
to get his father back. It&#8217;s sort of a
pity, &#8217;cording to my notion, that, being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
adrift so long, he didn&#8217;t go down in
deep-sea soundings, and not come
ashore to break up like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Captain Jeb, no, no!&#8221; Dan looked
up from his hammering on the &#8220;Sary
Ann&#8221; in quick protest against such false
doctrine. &#8220;A man isn&#8217;t like a ship: he
has a soul. And that&#8217;s the main thing,
after all. If you save your soul, it
doesn&#8217;t make much difference about
your body. And drifting ashore right
here has saved the soul of Mr. Wirt (or
Mr. Neville, as we must call him now);
for he was lying over on Last Island,
feeling that there was no hope for him
in heaven or on earth. And then
Freddy came to him, and Father Tom,
and he turned to God for pardon and
mercy; and now his dying is all right,&mdash;though
I haven&#8217;t given him up yet,&#8221; concluded
Dan, more cheerfully. &#8220;Poor
little Freddy has been praying so hard
all night, I feel he is going to be heard
somehow. And I&#8217;ve seen Mick Mulligan,
that had typhoid last summer,
looking a great deal worse than Mr.
Neville, and before Thanksgiving there
wasn&#8217;t a boy on the hill he couldn&#8217;t
throw. Here comes Father Tom back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
with&mdash;with&mdash;&#8221; Dan dropped his hammer
entirely, and stood up to stare in
amazement at the little motor boat making
its way to the broken wharf. &#8220;Jing!
Jerusalem! if&mdash;if it isn&#8217;t that pretty
lady from Beach Cliff that Polly calls
Marraine!&#8221;

<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XXIV.&mdash;A Star in the Darkness.</p>
</div>

<p>Marraine,&mdash;Polly&#8217;s Marraine,&mdash;Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s old friend,&mdash;the lovely, silver-robed
lady of the party who had stood
by Dan in his trouble!&mdash;it was she, indeed,
all dressed in white, with a pretty
little cap on her soft, wavy hair, and
her hands full of flowers. Miss Stella
always made a first appearance at a
patient&#8217;s bedside with flowers. She said
they were a friendly introduction that
never failed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the nurse woman they went
for,&#8221; gasped Captain Jeb, as the new
arrival proceeded to step from boat to
wharf with a light grace that scarcely
needed Father Tom&#8217;s assisting hand.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be tee-totally jiggered! Who
ever saw a nurse woman pretty as
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dan did not hear. He had
dropped nails, hammer, and all present
interest in the recuperation of the
&#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221; and was off down the
beach to meet the fair visitor, whose
coming he could not understand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Danny,&#8221; she said, holding out her
empty hand to him,&mdash;&#8220;Miss Winnie&#8217;s
Danny!&mdash;I told you I had friends here,
Father Rayburn; and this is one that I
expect to find my right-hand man. What
a queer, quaint, wonderful place this
Killykinick is! I am so glad you brought
me here to help you!&#8221;</p>
<p>Help them! Help them! Dan caught
the world in breathless amazement.
Then Miss Stella, Polly&#8217;s Marraine, was
the nurse! It seemed altogether astounding;
for sick nurses, in Dan&#8217;s experience,
had always been fat old ladies
who had out-lived all other duties, and
appeared only on important occasions,
to gossip in solemn whispers, and to
drink unlimited tea. And now Polly&#8217;s
Marraine was a <i>nurse</i>! It was impossible
to doubt the fact; for Father Tom
was leading her straight to Mr. Neville&#8217;s
side, Dan following in dumb bewilderment.</p>
<p>The sick man lay in the old Captain&#8217;s
room, whither, at his own request, the
life-savers had borne him the previous
evening. His eyes, deep-sunken in their
sockets, were closed, his features rigid.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Poor little Freddy, tearful and trembling,
knelt by Brother Bart, who
paused in his murmured prayers to
shake his head hopelessly at the newcomer&#8217;s
approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad ye&#8217;re here before he goes
entirely, Father. It&#8217;s time, I think, for
the last blessing. I am afraid he can
neither hear nor see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Miss Stella had stepped forward,
put her soft hand on the patient&#8217;s pulse;
and then, with a quick whisper to
Father Tom, she had dropped her
flowers, opened the little wrist-bag they
had concealed, and proceeded to &#8220;do
things,&#8221;&mdash;just what sort of things Dan
did not know. He could only see the soft
hands moving swiftly, deftly; baring
the patient&#8217;s arm to the shoulder and
flashing something sharp and shining
into the pale flesh; holding the fluttering
pulse until, with a long, deep sigh,
the sick man opened his eyes and stared
dully at the white-robed figure bending
over him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;what are you?&#8221; he said faintly.</p>
<p>Miss Stella smiled. It was the question
that many a patient, struggling out
of the Dark Valley, had asked before,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
when his waking eyes had fallen upon
her fair, sweet face, her white-robed
form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only your nurse,&#8221; she answered
softly,&mdash;&#8220;your nurse who has come to
help you, to take care of you. You feel
better already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, better, better!&#8221; was the faint
reply. &#8220;My boy,&mdash;where is my boy?
Freddy! Freddy!&#8221; He stretched out his
feeble hand. But it was met by a firm,
gentle grasp that was not Freddy&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;No boys now,&#8221; said Miss Stella in
the soft, steady voice of one used to such
commands. &#8220;There must be no seeing,
no talking, even no thinking, my patient.
You must take this powder I am
putting to your lips. Close your eyes
again and go to sleep.&mdash;Now please
everybody go away and leave him to
me,&#8221; was the whispered ukase, that
even Father Tom obeyed without protest;
and Miss Stella began her reign at
Killykinick.</p>
<p>It was a triumphant reign from the
very first. Old and young fell at once
under her gentle sway, and yielded to
her command without dispute. The
cabin of the &#8220;Lady Jane&#8221; was given to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
her entirely; even Brother Bart taking
to the upper deck; while a big, disused
awning was stretched into a shelter for
the morning and the noontime mess.</p>
<p>And, to say nothing of her patient&mdash;who
lay, as Brother Bart expressed it,
&#8220;like a shorn lamb&#8221; under her gentle
bidding, gaining health and strength
each day,&mdash;every creature in Killykinick
was subservient to Miss Stella&#8217;s sweet
will. Freddy was her devoted slave;
lazy Jim, ready to move at her whisper;
even Dud, after learning her father&#8217;s
rank in the army, was ready to oblige
her as a gentleman should. But it was
Dan, as she had foreseen from the first,
who was her right-hand man, ready to
fetch and carry, to lift any burden, however
heavy, by day and night; Dan who
rowed or sailed or skimmed to any point
in the motor boat Father Tom kept
waiting at her demand; Dan who, when
the patient grew better, and she had an
hour or two off, was her willing and
delighted escort over rocks or sea.</p>
<p>And as they sailed or rowed or
loitered by beach and shore, Miss Stella
drew from Aunt Winnie&#8217;s boy the hopes
and fears he could not altogether hide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
She learned how Aunt Winnie was
&#8220;pining&#8221; for her home and her boy; she
read the letters, with their untold love
and longing; she saw the look on the
boyish face when Dan, too mindful of
his promise to Father Mack to speak
plainly, said he &#8216;reckoned she wouldn&#8217;t
be here long if he didn&#8217;t get her somehow
<i>home</i>.&#8217; She learned, too, all Dan
could tell about poor old Nutty&#8217;s medal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get it for me the next time you go to
town, Danny,&#8221; she said to him. And
Danny drew it from old Jonah&#8217;s junk
shop and put it in Miss Stella&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>And then, when at last her patient
was able to sit up in Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s
big chair in the cabin doorway and look
out at the sea, Miss Stella wrote to dad
and Polly to come and take her home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, but we&#8217;ll all miss her!&#8221; Captain
Jeb voiced the general sentiment of
Killykinick when this decision was made
public. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t much sot on women
folks when you&#8217;re in deep water, but
this one suttenly shone out like a star
in the dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And kept a-shining,&#8221; added Neb,&mdash;&#8220;a-shining
and a-smiling straight
through.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a good girl,&#8221; said Brother
Bart. &#8220;And I&#8217;m thinking&mdash;well, it
doesn&#8217;t matter what I&#8217;m thinking. But
it&#8217;s a lonely time laddie&#8217;s poor father
will be having, after all his wild wanderings;
and it will be hard for him to
keep house and home. But the Lord is
good. Maybe it was His hand that led
Miss Stella here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what will we do when she is
gone, daddy?&#8221; mourned Freddy. &#8220;Of
course you are getting well now, and
Dan and I can wait on you and get you
broth and jelly; but it won&#8217;t be like
having dear Miss Stella. Oh, I just love
her! Don&#8217;t you, daddy? She is almost
as good as a real mother.&#8221;</p>
<p>And daddy&#8217;s pale cheek had flushed
as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost, little Boy Blue!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re all going home in a
week,&#8221; said Dan, as he stood out under
the stars that night. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll miss you
sure, Miss Stella; for you don&#8217;t mind
being friends with a rough sort of a boy
like me, and you know Aunt Winnie;
and if I give up and&mdash;and go down
you&#8217;ll&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give up and go down!&#8221; repeated
Miss Stella. &#8220;You give up and go down,
Danny? Never,&mdash;never! You&#8217;re the
sort of boy to climb, however steep and
rough and sharp the way,&mdash;to climb to
the stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what Aunt Winnie dreams,&#8221;
was the answer. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I dream,
too, sometimes. Miss Stella. But it
isn&#8217;t for me to dream: I have to wake
up and hustle. I can&#8217;t stay dreaming
and let Aunt Winnie die. So if I have
to give up and go down, Miss Stella,
you&#8217;ll&mdash;you&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Miss Stella steadied her voice to
answer:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Danny, I&#8217;ll understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, in spite of this, Miss Stella&#8217;s
parting from Killykinick was not altogether
a sad one; for &#8220;The Polly&#8221; came
down next morning, with flying colors,
to bear her away. Dad was aboard;
also Polly, jubilant at recovering her
dear Marraine after three weeks of desertion;
and Captain Carleton, and Miss
Stella&#8217;s girl friends who had been
picked up from the camp at Shelter
Cove. It was such a picnic party altogether
that sighs and tears seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
quite out of place; for, after all, things
had turned out most cheerfully, as
everybody agreed.</p>
<p>So, with &#8220;The Polly&#8221; glittering in
new paint and gilding necessitated by
the storm, with all her pennants flying
in the wind, with the victrola singing its
merriest boat song, and snowy handkerchiefs
fluttering gay farewells, Miss
Stella was borne triumphantly away. It
was to be an all-day cruise. Great
hampers, packed with everything good
to eat and drink, were stored below;
and &#8220;The Polly&#8221; spread her wings and
took a wide flight to sea, turning back
only when the shadows began to deepen
over the water, and the stars to peep
from the violet sky. The young people
were a trifle tired; Polly had fallen
asleep on a pile of cushions, while the
girls from Shelter Cove sang college
songs.</p>
<p>In the stern, Captain Carleton had
found his way to Miss Stella&#8217;s side. She
was leaning on the taffrail, listening to
the singing, her white fleecy wrap falling
around her like a cloud.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look your name to-night,&#8221; said
the Captain: &#8220;Stella,&mdash;a star. By
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
George, you were a star to me when the
sky looked pretty black! I was thinking
of that yesterday when some Eastern
chap came along with a lot of diamonds
for sale. I don&#8217;t know much about such
folderols, but there was one piece&mdash;a
star&mdash;that I&#8217;d like to give you, if you
would take it and wear it in remembrance
of a rough old fellow who can&#8217;t
speak all he feels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Captain Carleton,&mdash;Captain
Carleton!&#8221; laughed the lady softly.
&#8220;Take care! That Eastern chap was
fooling you, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all,&mdash;not at all!&#8221; was the
quick reply. &#8220;I got an expert&#8217;s opinion.
The star is worth the thousand dollars
he asked.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A thousand dollars,&mdash;a thousand
dollars!&#8221; repeated Miss Stella, in dismay.
&#8220;And you would give me a thousand
dollar star? Why, you must have
money to burn, indeed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose I have,&#8221; was the
answer,&mdash;&#8220;much more than a lonely old
fellow of sixty odd, without chick or
child will ever need. Will you take the
star, dear lady nurse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Miss Stella, gently;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
&#8220;though I thank you for your generous
thought of me, my good friend. But I
have a better and a wiser investment
for you. Have you forgotten this?&#8221;
She took Dan&#8217;s medal from the bag on
her wrist.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, I <i>did</i> forget it!&#8221; said the
old man. &#8220;Somehow, it slipped my
memory completely in our pleasant
hurry. Poor Jack Farley&#8217;s medal!
You&#8217;ve found the chap that owns it, you
say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the answer&mdash;&#8220;a brave,
sturdy, honest little chap, who stood by
your poor old friend in his last lonely
days, and helped him in his last lonely
cruise, and took the medal from his
dying hands as the last and only legacy
he had to give. Would you consider him
Jack Farley&#8217;s heir, Captain Carleton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly I would,&#8221; was the
rejoinder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then make him his heir,&#8221; she said
softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh!&mdash;what? I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221;
muttered the old gentleman.</p>
<p>Then Miss Stella explained. It was
such an explanation as only gentle
speakers like Miss Stella can make. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
told about bright, brave, plucky Dan
and Aunt Winnie, of the scholarship at
St. Andrew&#8217;s and of the Little Sisters of
the Poor. She told of the attic home
over the Mulligans&#8217; for which Aunt
Winnie was &#8220;pining,&#8221; and of the
dreams that Dan dreamed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would seem a pity,&#8221; Miss Stella
said, &#8220;for him to give up and go down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, he must not,&mdash;he shall
not!&#8221; said the old sailor. &#8220;You want
me to do something for him? Out with
it, my lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I want you to invest, not in
diamond stars, Captain, but in Jack
Farley&#8217;s medal. I was to negotiate the
sale, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! And you warned me you
were going to fleece me; so go on,&mdash;go
on! What is the boy&#8217;s&mdash;what is
your price?&#8221; asked the Captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;A pension,&#8221; said Miss Stella, softly,
&#8220;the pension you would give Jack Farley&mdash;if
he were here to claim it,&mdash;just the
little pension an old sailor would ask
for his last watch below. It will hold
the little nest under the eaves that Danny
calls home for the old aunt that he
loves; it will steady the young wings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
for their flight to the stars; it will keep
the young heart brave and pure and
warm as only love and home can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&mdash;you&#8217;re right,&mdash;you&#8217;re
always right, dear lady! If old Jack
were here, I&#8217;d pension him, as you say,
and fling in a little extra for his grog
and his pipe. Old Jack could have
counted on me for four or five hundred
a year. But a sturdy, strapping young
chap like yours is worth a dozen groggy
old salts. So name your figure, my
lady. I have money to burn, as you
say. Name your figure, dear lady, and
I&#8217;ll invest in your boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old Jack&#8217;s pension, then, Captain
Carleton,&mdash;old Jack&#8217;s pension for Aunt
Winnie and Dan,&mdash;old Jack&#8217;s pension,
and nothing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s theirs,&#8221; was the hearty answer,&mdash;&#8220;or,
rather, it&#8217;s yours, my dear lady!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; she disclaimed.
&#8220;The generous gift is all your own,
dear friend,&mdash;all your own. And it will
be repaid. Dan and his good old aunt
may have no words to thank you, to
bless you; but some day&#8221; (and the glad
voice grew softer, sweeter),&mdash;&#8220;some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
day when life&#8217;s long voyage is over for
you, Captain, and the log-book is open
to the Master&#8217;s gaze&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a tough showing,&#8221; interrupted
the old man, gruffly,&mdash;&#8220;a tough
showing through and through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no, no!&#8221; she said gently.
&#8220;One entry, I am sure, will clear many
a page, dear friend. One entry will
give you safe anchorage&mdash;harbor
rights; for has not the Master Himself
said, &#8216;As long as you did it to one of
these My least brethren, you did it to
Me&#8217;?&#8221;

<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XXV.&mdash;Going Home.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re to be off to-morrow,&#8221; said
Brother Bart, a little sadly. &#8220;And,
though it will be a blessed thing to get
back in the holy peace of St. Andrew&#8217;s,
with the boys all safe and sound&mdash;which
is a mercy I couldn&#8217;t expect,&mdash;to
say nothing of laddie&#8217;s father being
drawn out of his wanderings into the
grace of God, I&#8217;m sore-hearted at leaving
Killykinick. You&#8217;ve been very good
to us, Jeroboam,&mdash;both you and your
brother, who is a deal wiser than at
first sight you&#8217;d think. You&#8217;ve been
true friends both in light and darkness;
and may God reward you and
bring you to the true faith! That will
be my prayer for you night and day.&mdash;And
now you&#8217;re to pack up, boys, and
get all your things together; for it&#8217;s
Father Regan&#8217;s orders that we are to
come back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is <i>our</i> home, daddy?&#8221; asked
Freddy, with lively interest. &#8220;For we
can have a real true home now, can&#8217;t
we?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so, my boy.&#8221; They were out
on the smooth stretch of beach, where
daddy, growing strong and well fast,
spent most of his time, stretched out
in one of Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s cushiony
chairs; while Roy and Rex crouched
contentedly at his feet, or broke into
wild frolic with Freddy on the rocks or
in the sea. &#8220;I hope so; though I&#8217;m
afraid I don&#8217;t know much about making
a home, my little Boy Blue!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t you, daddy?&#8221; said Freddy,
ruefully. &#8220;I have always wanted a
home so much,&mdash;a real true home, with
curtains and carpets, and pictures on
the walls, and a real fire that snaps and
blazes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I heard you say that before,&#8221;
answered his father, softly. &#8220;I think it
was that little talk on the boat that
brought me down, where I could take a
peep at my homeless little boy again;
though I was afraid Captain Jeb would
find me out if I ventured to Killykinick.
I was just making up my mind to risk
it and go over, when this fever caught
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why&mdash;were you hiding, daddy?
Why did you stay away so long?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Life had grown very black for me;
and I didn&#8217;t want to make it black for
you, Freddy. I lost faith and hope and
love when I lost your mother. I
couldn&#8217;t settle down to a bare, lonely
life without her. I felt I must be free,&mdash;free
to wander where I willed. It
was all wrong,&mdash;all wrong, Freddy.
But daddy was in darkness, without any
guiding star. So I left you to Uncle
Tom, gave up my name, my home, and
broke loose like a ship without rudder
or sail. And where it led me, where
you found me, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes!&#8221; Freddy laid his soft young
cheek against his father&#8217;s. &#8220;It was all
wrong. But now you have come back;
and everything is right again, Uncle
Tom says; and we&#8217;ll have a real home
together. He said that, too, before he
went away,&mdash;you and I would have a
home, daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try,&#8221; replied daddy, cheerfully.
&#8220;With you and the dogs together, Freddy,
we&#8217;ll try. We&#8217;ll get the house and
the cushions and the carpets, and do
our best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Going home! Dan was thinking of it,
too, a little sadly, as somewhat later he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
stood on the stretch of rocks, looking
out at the fading west. He was going
home to &#8220;give up.&#8221; Only yesterday
morning a brief scrawl from Pete Patterson
had informed him he would be
ready for business next week, and Dan
must come back with an answer&mdash;&#8220;Yes&#8221;
or &#8220;No.&#8221; So it was good-bye to
St. Andrew&#8217;s for Dan to-night; good-bye
to all his hopes and dreams to-morrow.
Something seemed to rise in
Dan&#8217;s throat at the thought. To-morrow
he must go back, a college boy no
longer, but to Pete Patterson&#8217;s wagon
and Pete Patterson&#8217;s shop.</p>
<p>And while he stood there alone,
watching the deepening shadows gather
over rock and reef and shoal where he
had spent such happy days, there came
a sudden burst of glad music over the
waters, and around the bending shore
of Killykinick came a fairy vision:
&#8220;The Polly,&#8221; fluttering with gay pennants,
jewelled in colored light from
stem to stern; &#8220;The Polly,&#8221; laden with
a crowd of merrymakers in most hilarious
mood, coming on a farewell feast in
charge of three white-capped and white-coated
waiters; &#8220;The Polly,&#8221; that swept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
triumphantly to the mended wharf
(where the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221; was slowly recuperating
from her damages, in a
fresh coat of paint and brand-new mainsail),
and took undisputed possession of
Killykinick.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just had to come and say good-bye,&#8221;
declared Miss Polly; &#8220;and dad
said I could make a party of it, if Marraine
would take us in charge. And so
we&#8217;re to have a real, <i>real</i> last good
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then all sat down on the moonlit
sands; and the victrola played its gayest
tunes, and the white-capped waiters
served good things that quite equalled
Polly&#8217;s last party. And when that was
nearly over, and the guests were still
snapping the French &#8220;kisses&#8221; and
cracking sugar-shelled nuts, Dan found
Miss Stella, who had been chatting with
her late patient most of the evening,
standing at his side. Perhaps it was
the moonlight, but he thought he had
never seen her look so lovely. Her eyes
were like stars, and there was a soft
rose-flush on her cheek, and the smile
on her sweet lips seemed to kindle her
whole face into radiance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come sit down on the rocks beside
me, Danny,&mdash;Miss Winnie&#8217;s Danny.
I&#8217;ve got some news for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;News for me?&#8221; Danny lifted his
eyes; and Miss Stella saw that, in spite
of all the fun and frolic around him,
they looked strangely sad and dull.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not having a good time to-night,
are you?&#8221; she asked softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am&mdash;or at least I&#8217;m trying,&#8221;
said Dan, stoutly. &#8220;It was surely nice
of you all to give us this send off. But&mdash;but,
you see, I can&#8217;t help feeling a
little bad, because&mdash;because&mdash;&#8221; and he
had to stop to clear the lump from his
throat. &#8220;It seems to sort of end things
for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Danny, Danny, no it doesn&#8217;t!&#8221;
And now Miss Stella&#8217;s eyes were stars
indeed. &#8220;It&#8217;s the beginning of things
bright and beautiful for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, in sweet, trembling, joyful
tones, she told him all,&mdash;told him of
Captain Carleton and the medal; of the
pension that was to be his and Aunt
Winnie&#8217;s; of the kind, strong hand that
had been stretched out to help him, that
he might keep on without hindrance,&mdash;keep
on his upward way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To the stars, Danny,&#8221; concluded the
gentle speaker softly. &#8220;We must take
the highest aim, even if we fail to reach
it,&mdash;to the stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;O Miss Stella,&mdash;dear, dear Miss
Stella!&#8221; and the sob came surely now,
in Dan&#8217;s bewildered joy, his gratitude,
his relief. &#8220;How good you are,&mdash;how
good you are! Oh, I will try to deserve
it all, Miss Stella! A home for Aunt
Winnie, and St. Andrew&#8217;s,&mdash;<i>St. Andrew&#8217;s</i>
again!&#8221; And Dan sprang to his
feet, and the college cry went ringing
over the moonlit rocks. &#8220;It&#8217;s St. Andrew&#8217;s
for Dan Dolan, now forever!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rest of that evening seemed a
bewildering dream to Dan,&mdash;more bewildering
even than Miss Polly&#8217;s party.
The story of his medal and his luck
went flying around Killykinick, with
most dazzling additions. Before the
guests departed, Dan was a hero indeed,
adopted by a millionaire whose
life his father or uncle or somebody had
saved from sharks and whales fifty or
seventy-five years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; said Polly, as she
shook hands for good-bye. &#8220;I always
did say you were the nicest boy in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
world. And now you needn&#8217;t ever be a
newsboy or bootblack again, Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you again before very long,&#8221;
said Miss Stella, as he helped her on the
boat, and she slipped a gold piece in his
hand. &#8220;Here is the price of Jack Farley&#8217;s
medal. You must take Aunt Winnie
home right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I will,&mdash;I will, indeed!&#8221; said Dan
joyfully. &#8220;She will be back in Mulligan&#8217;s
as soon as I can get her there, you
bet, Miss Stella!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m durn sorry to see you go,
matey!&#8221; said Captain Jeb next morning,
as they pulled out the new sails of
the &#8220;Sary Ann&#8221; for a start. &#8220;But whenever
you want a whiff of salt air and a
plunge in salt water, why, Killykinick
is here and your job of second mate
open to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake on that!&#8221; said Dan, gripping
his old friend&#8217;s hand. &#8220;If I know myself,
I&#8217;ll be down every summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks as if I owed you something
for all that fishing,&#8221; remarked old Neb,
pulling out his leather wallet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a cent!&#8221; said Dan, briskly.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a monied man now, Neb,&mdash;a regular
up-and-down plute. Keep the cash
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
for some new nets next summer when
we go fishing again.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, with friendly words and
wishes from all, even from Dud, whom
recent events had quite knocked out of
his usual grandeur, the whole party
bade adieu to Killykinick. Freddy and
his father were to remain a while at
Beach Cliff with Father Tom, who was
taking his holiday there.</p>
<p>At Brother Bart&#8217;s request, the home
journey was to be made as much as possible
by rail, so after the &#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221;
still a little stiff and creaky in the
joints, had borne them to the steamboat,
which in a few hours touched the
mainland and made connections with
the train, the travellers&#8217; route lay along
scenes very different from the rugged
rocks and sands they had left. As they
swept by golden harvest fields and
ripening orchards and vineyards whose
rich yield was purpling in the autumn
sun, good Brother Bart heaved a sigh
of deepest content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you may say what you please
about water, Danny lad, but God&#8217;s
blessing is on the good green land. If
it be the Lord&#8217;s will, I&#8217;ll never leave it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
again; though we might have found
worse places than Killykinick and those
good old men there,&mdash;may God lead
them to the Light!&#8221;</p>
<p>And as the Limited Express made its
schedule time, Pete Patterson was just
closing up as usual at sundown, when a
sturdy, brown-cheeked boy burst into
his store,&mdash;a boy that it took Pete&#8217;s
keen eyes full half a minute to recognize.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan Dolan!&#8221; he cried at last,&mdash;&#8220;Dan
Dolan, grown and fattened and
slicked up like&mdash;like a yearling heifer!
Danny boy, I&#8217;m glad to see you,&mdash;I&#8217;m
glad to see you, sure! You&#8217;ve come to
take the job?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I haven&#8217;t,&mdash;thank you all the
same, Pete!&#8221; was the quick answer.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve struck luck for sure,&mdash;luck with a
fine old plute, who is ready to stake me
for all I could earn here, and keep me at
St. Andrew&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stake you for all you could earn
here?&#8221; echoed Pete, in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all about it later,&#8221; said
Dan, breathlessly. &#8220;Just now I&#8217;m dumb
struck, Pete. I came flying back to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
take up my old quarters at the Mulligans&#8217;
and find the house shut up and
everybody gone. Land! It did give me
a turn, sure! I was counting on that
little room upstairs, and all Aunt Winnie&#8217;s
things she left there, and Tabby
and the stove and the blue teapot. But
they&#8217;re all gone.&#8221; And Dan sank down
on a big packer&#8217;s box feeling that he
was facing a dissolving world in which
he had no place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re not far!&#8221; said Pete, a
little gruffly; for Dan&#8217;s tidings had
been somewhat of a blow. &#8220;The old
woman&#8217;s father died and left a little
bit of money, and they bought a tidy little
place out on Cedar Place, not far
from St. Mary&#8217;s Church. You&#8217;ll find
them there. You&#8217;ve made up your mind
for good and all to stick to the highbrows?
I&#8217;d make it worth your while
to come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan rose from the packer&#8217;s box and
looked around at the hams and shoulders
and lard buckets and answered out
of the fulness of his grateful heart:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve made up my mind, Pete.
It&#8217;s St. Andrew&#8217;s for me,&mdash;St. Andrew&#8217;s
now and, I hope, forever. But&mdash;but if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
you want any help with writing or figuring,
I&#8217;ll come around Saturday nights
and give you a lift; for I won&#8217;t be far.
I&#8217;m sticking to old friends and the old
camping ground still.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with this cheery assurance, Dan
was off again to find the vanished roof
tree that had been all he ever knew of
home. He recalled the place. It was
only a short walk from the college gate.
Indeed, the row of cedars that fronted
the little whitewashed house had been
once the boundary of the college
grounds. There was a bit of a garden
in front, and a porch with late roses
climbing over it, and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>
<p>Dan stood stock-still for a moment,&mdash;then
he flung open the little gate, and
with a regular Sioux war-whoop dashed
up the gravelled path; for there&mdash;there
seated in Mrs. Mulligan&#8217;s best
rocker, with Tabby curled up at her
feet&mdash;was Aunt Winnie herself, drinking
a cup of tea!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p style=' font-size:1.2em; margin-top:2em; font-variant:small-caps;'>XXVI.&mdash;Rainbows.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Danny!&#8221; cried Aunt Winnie, clutching
her teacup with trembling hand.
&#8220;God save us, it&#8217;s Danny himself!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody else,&#8221; said Dan, as he caught
her in a bearish hug and kissed the
withered cheek again and again. It
looked paler than when he had left her,&mdash;paler
and thinner; and there were
hollows under the patient eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what are you doing here, Aunt
Win?&#8221; he asked in amazement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just spending the day, Danny. Mrs.
Mulligan sent Molly for me this morning.
She wanted me to see her new
place, and to tell her what was to be
done with my bit of things. She is
thinking of renting her rooms, and my
things are in the way. They are fine
rooms, with rosebud paper on the walls,
and a porch looking out at the church
beyant; and she could be getting seven
dollars a month for them. But she&#8217;s got
the table and stove and beds, and all
our old furniture that nobody would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
want; so I&#8217;ve told her to send them off
to-morrow to sell for what they will
bring. Sure&#8221; (and the old voice trembled)
&#8220;we&#8217;ll never have any call for them
again, Danny lad,&mdash;never again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we won&#8217;t?&#8221; said Danny, with another
hug that came near doing for teacup
completely. &#8220;Just take back your
orders quick as you can, Aunt Winnie,
I&#8217;m renting those rooms right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, Danny,&mdash;Danny boy, have ye
come back with a fever on ye?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; grinned Dan,&mdash;&#8220;regular gold
fever, Aunt Winnie! Look at that!&#8221; He
clapped the twenty dollar gold piece into
Aunt Winnie&#8217;s trembling hand.
&#8220;That&#8217;s for you, Aunt Winnie,&mdash;that&#8217;s
to rent those pink-flowered rooms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s mad the poor boy is entirely!&#8221;
cried Aunt Winnie, as Mrs.
Mulligan and Molly came hurrying out
on the porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I look it?&#8221; asked Dan, laughing
into their startled faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ye don&#8217;t,&#8221; said Mrs. Mulligan. &#8220;But
spake out plain, and don&#8217;t be bewildering
the poor woman, Danny Dolan.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Danny spoke out as plain
as his breathless eagerness would permit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
and told the story of the &#8220;pension.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be thirty-five dollars a month,
Captain Carleton says; he&#8217;d have to
throw in the five to poor old Nutty for
grog and tobacco.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, God save us,&mdash;God save us!&#8221;
was all Aunt Winnie could murmur,
tearfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I guess thirty-five dollars will
run those rosebud rooms of yours pretty
safe and slick; won&#8217;t they, Mrs. Mulligan?
So put Aunt Winnie and me
down as tenants right off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&mdash;I will!&#8221; answered Mrs. Mulligan,
joyfully. &#8220;Sure my heart was
like lead in my breast at the thought of
giving up yer bit of things, Miss Winnie.
But now,&mdash;now come along, Molly
girl, and we&#8217;ll be fixing the rooms, this
minute. What&#8217;s the good of yer going
back to the Sisters at all?&#8221; And Mrs.
Mulligan put a motherly arm around
Aunt Winnie&#8217;s trembling form. &#8220;Give
her another cup of tea, Molly; for she&#8217;s
all done up with joy at having her own
home and her own boy again, thank
God for that same!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then, leaving dear Aunt Winnie
to this good friend&#8217;s tender ministrations,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
Dan kept on his way to St. Andrew&#8217;s,
taking a flying leap over the college
wall to the sunset walk, where perhaps
he would find Father Mack saying
his Office. He was not mistaken: his
old friend was there, walking slowly under
the arching trees. His face kindled
into light as he stretched out a trembling
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought perhaps you would come
here, my boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was just
thanking God, Danny. Brother Bart
has told us the good news. It is all
right, as I hoped and prayed,&mdash;all right,
as I <i>knew</i> it would be, Danny. Now tell
me, yourself, all about this wonderful
blessing.&#8221;</p>
<p>And again this father and son sat
down upon the broken grave slab, and
Danny told Father Mack all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, it is the good God&#8217;s hand!&#8221; the
old priest said softly. &#8220;But this is only
the start, my son. The climb is still
before you,&mdash;a climb that may lead over
steeps sharp and rough as the rocks of
Killykinick.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the fading light seemed to aureole
Father Mack&#8217;s silvery head as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will keep on and up,&mdash;on and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
up; for God is calling you, my son,&mdash;calling
you to heights where He leads
His own&mdash;heights which as yet you can
not see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker laid his hand upon Dan&#8217;s
head in benediction that thrilled the
boy&#8217;s heart to its deepest depths,&mdash;a
benediction that he never forgot; for it
was Father Mack&#8217;s last. Only a few
days later the college bell&#8217;s solemn note,
sounding over the merry greetings of
the gathering students, told that for the
good old priest all the lessons of life
were over.</p>
<p>And Dan, climbing sturdily up the
heights at his saintly guide&#8217;s bidding,
has found the way, so far, smoothed
and softened beyond his hopes by his
summer at Killykinick. Even his
stumbling-stone Dud was removed to
another college, his father having been
ordered to a Western post. With Jim
and Freddy as his friends, all the &#8220;high-steppers,&#8221;
old and young, of St. Andrew&#8217;s
were ready to welcome him into
rank and line. And, with Aunt Winnie
as administratrix of Captain Carleton&#8217;s
pension &#8220;there isn&#8217;t a dacinter-looking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
boy in the college,&#8221; as Mrs. Mulligan
stoutly declares.</p>
<p>How Aunt Winnie stretched out that
pension only the Irish fairies, or perhaps
the Irish angels, know. The little pink-flowered
rooms have blossomed out into
a very bower of comfort and cheer.
There are frilly curtains at the windows,
a rosy-hued lamp, and a stand of
growing plants always in bloom. There
are always bread and cheese and apple
sauce, or something equally &#8220;filling,&#8221;
for hungry boys to eat.</p>
<p>And when Aunt Winnie was fairly
settled, who should appear but Miss
Stella, who had come to nurse a dear old
friend near by,&mdash;Miss Stella, who dropped
in most naturally in her off hours to
chat with dear old Aunt Winnie and
take a cup of tea! And Freddy&#8217;s daddy,
who had plunged into life and law business
with zest, often brought his big automobile
round to take Freddy for a
spin after study hours, and called on the
way very frequently to take Miss Stella
home.</p>
<p>It was on one of those bright afternoons
that they all went to look at the
new house that was going up on a wooded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
hillside not very far from the college&mdash;the
house that was to be Freddy&#8217;s
long-wished-for home. It had been a lot
of fun watching it grow. Now it was
nearly done,&mdash;the big pillared porch
ready for its climbing roses; the pretty
rooms waiting their rugs and curtains;
the great stone chimney, that was to be
the heart and life of things, rising in
the center of all.</p>
<p>&#8220;My! but this in fine!&#8221; said Freddy,
who had not seen this crowning touch
before. &#8220;Let&#8217;s light it up, daddy,&mdash;let&#8217;s
light it up and see how it burns.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, dashing out for an armful of
wood left by the builders, Freddy soon
had a glorious blaze on the new hearthstone,&mdash;a
blaze that, blending with the
sunset streaming through the west windows,
made things bright indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is great!&#8221; said Freddy. &#8220;And
when we have the chairs and tables
and cushions and curtains&mdash;who is
going to pick out the cushions and curtains,
dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose we can have them sent
up from the store!&#8221; answered dad, anticipating
such matters by pushing up a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span>
big packing box to the fire, to serve as
a seat for their smiling guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, can&#8217;t you do it, daddy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;George! no! I wouldn&#8217;t know a curtain
from a rug, my boy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t know about dishes or
cups, or pans to make gingerbread,&#8221; continued
Freddy, the glow fading from
his face as he realized all these masculine
disabilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a thing,&#8221; was dad&#8217;s reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; said Freddy, in a much
troubled voice. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be right bad off
for a real home, after all, daddy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we can find a nice old black
mammy who will take care of us all,&#8221;
observed daddy, his eyes twinkling almost
as they used to twinkle in the days
of little Boy Blue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose we can,&#8221; said Freddy,
with a wistful little sigh, &#8220;I suppose
that is what we will <i>have</i> to do, daddy.
But I wish&mdash;it&#8217;s going to be such
a pretty house every other way,&mdash;I
wish we could have a pretty lady to sit
at the head of the table and pour our
tea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would <i>I</i> do, Freddy?&#8221; asked Miss
Stella, stealing a soft little hand into his.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You, Miss Stella,&mdash;<i>you</i>,&mdash;<i>you</i>?&#8221;
gasped Freddy. &#8220;Oh, that would be
rip-roaring, sure enough! But you
couldn&#8217;t,&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; was the low answer; and
Miss Stella arose and drew little Boy
Blue to her loving heart. &#8220;I might come
if you want me very much, Freddy,&mdash;so
I promised daddy last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For there is no real right home
without a mother, son,&#8221; said daddy; and
his arm went around to meet Miss
Stella&#8217;s until Freddy was locked in their
double clasp. And, looking from one
glad face to the other, a thousand rainbows
seemed to burst upon his troubled
sky, and little Boy Blue understood.</p>
<p>So there was a wedding in the little
church at Beach Cliff when the hydrangeas
were in bloom the next summer,&mdash;a
wedding that drew the Forester clan
from far and near. Even the two
grandmothers, after they had inspected
the Neville family tree through their
lorgnettes, declared their satisfaction
that Stella was going to do the proper
thing at last.</p>
<p>Daddy was the daddy of old times,
before the dark clouds of doubt and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
despair had gathered around him and
he had drifted about, the derelict Mr.
Wirt; while Miss Stella, veiled in soft
mists of tulle, looked what she had been,
to him, what she would ever be to him&mdash;his
guiding star. Polly, who was the
only bridesmaid (for so Marraine would
have it), carried a basket of flowers as
big as herself; Father Tom said the
Nuptial Mass; and Freddy stood at daddy&#8217;s
side, the very happiest of &#8220;best
men.&#8221; And Dan who was off on his
summer vacation at Killykinick, came
down in the &#8220;Sary Ann,&#8221; with Captain
Jeb slicked up for the occasion in real
&#8220;store clothes.&#8221; And there was a wonderful
wedding feast at the Forester
home, with a cake three stories high,
and three tables full of wedding presents;
Captain Carleton&#8217;s diamond star,
that he <i>would</i> send, shining with dazzling
light among the rest.</p>
<p>And, then, such a house-warming followed
as surpassed Freddy&#8217;s wildest
dreams with a real fire leaping on the
hearth, with the rugs and curtains and
cushions just right; for Miss Stella (or
Marraine as she chose that Freddy
should call her,&mdash;for, as she said, &#8220;Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
own dear mother is in heaven, my boy&#8221;),&mdash;Miss
Stella had picked them all out
herself. And Father Tom beamed happily
on his reconstructed family; and
the Fathers and Brothers and boys
from St. Andrew&#8217;s dropped in without
ceremony; for Marraine had welcome
for all, now that she was a fixed star in
her real home and her real place.</p>
<p>Though dear Aunt Winnie has dropped
at least ten years of her life, and
old Neb&#8217;s whale oil has done more for
her rheumatism than all the store medicines
she ever tried; though more joy
and comfort has come into these sunset
years than she ever dared hope, she still
sits on her little porch in the evening,
with a look in her old eyes that tells she
is dreaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you see, Aunt Win?&#8221; asked
Dan one evening as after a tough pull
up the Hill of Knowledge, he bounded
up the Mulligan stairs to drop at her
feet and lay his head in her lap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure it&#8217;s not for an old woman to
spake, Danny dear!&#8221; she answered
again as of old. &#8220;It&#8217;s too great, too
high. What was it that holy saint,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
Father Mack, said to you, alanna?
Sometimes I forget the words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That it would be a hard climb for
me against winds and storms,&#8221; said
Dan. &#8220;And, golly, it will! I am finding
that out myself, Aunt Win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, lad! There was more,&mdash;there
was more,&#8221; said the old woman, eagerly.</p>
<p>After a moment&#8217;s pause, Dan added,
in a voice that had grown low and reverent:</p>
<p>&#8220;That God was calling me to His own.
And, Aunt Win,&mdash;Aunt Win&#8221; (there
was a new light in the blue eyes uplifted
to her face), &#8220;I am finding that out,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it is a long way to the starlit
heights of Aunt Winnie&#8217;s dream,&mdash;a
long, hard way, as Danny knows. We
leave him climbing sturdily on over its
rocky steeps and sunlit stretches, but
finding many a sunlit resting place on
the way. Brightest of all these to Danny
is Killykinick, where he goes every
summer to spend a happy holiday,&mdash;to
boat, to swim, to fish, to be &#8220;matey&#8221;
again with the two old men, who look
for his coming as the joy of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hurrah! hurrah, Aunt Win!&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
wrote jubilantly one glad summer day.
&#8220;Your Danny is at work before time,
doing a little missionary business already.
Two real true converts, Aunt
Win,&mdash;baptized yesterday! It was the
&#8216;Padre&#8217;s preaching&#8217; that set Jeb thinking
first, and then he got hold of some
of Great-uncle Joe&#8217;s books. I sort of
took a hand, and altogether we&#8217;ve got
the dear old chaps into the fold. Peter
and Andrew,&mdash;they chose the names
themselves, even good old Neb&#8217;s dull
wits seeming to wake at his Master&#8217;s
call. Brother Bart&#8217;s prayers for his
old friends have been answered. The
Light is shining on Killykinick, Aunt
Win,&mdash;the Light is shining on Killykinick!&#8221;</p>
